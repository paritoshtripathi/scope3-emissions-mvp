Until recently, \ncompanies have focused on emissions from their own operations under \nscope 1 and scope 2 of the GHG Protocol. Increasingly companies understand  the \nneed to also account for GHG emissions along their value chains and  product  \nportfolios to comprehensively manage GHG-related risks and opportunities.   \n  \nThe GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting  \nStandard (referred to as the Scope 3 Standard ), the parent document to this  \nguidance, offers an internationally accepted method to enable GHG management \nof companies\u2019 value chains. This guidance document serves as a companion to  \nthe Scope 3 Standard to offer companies practical guidance on calculating their scope 3 emissions. It provides information not contained in the Scope 3 Standard , \nsuch as methods for calculating GHG emissions for each of the 15 scope 3 categories, data sources, and worked examples.\nPlease refer to the Scope 3 Standard for requirements and guidance related to \nscope 3 accounting and reporting.

Scope 3 includes all other \nindirect emissions that occur in a company\u2019s value chain. The 15 categories in scope 3 are intended to provide \ncompanies with a systematic framework to measure, manage, and reduce emissions across a corporate value chain.  \nThe categories are designed to be mutually exclusive to avoid a company double counting emissions among categories. \nTable I gives descriptions of each of the 15 categories.

This document should be used in conjunction with the Scope 3 \nStandard when calculating emissions. The following Scope 3 Standard chapters contain information that is especially \nrelevant to performing various emissions calculations: \n \u2022Chapter 4, which defines the accounting and reporting principles (relevance, completeness, consistency, \ntransparency, accuracy)\n \u2022Chapter 5, which defines each of the 15 scope 3 categories and provides detailed descriptions of which activities are included in each scope 3 category\n \u2022Chapter 6, which provides guidance on setting the scope 3 boundary \n \u2022Chapter 7, which provides guidance on collecting data, including prioritizing data collection efforts, selecting among different types of data, and ensuring data quality\n \u2022Chapter 8, which provides guidance on allocating emissions \n \u2022Chapter 10, which describes assurance procedures\n \u2022Chapter 11, which defines scope 3 reporting requirements \n \u2022Appendix B, which describes uncertainty in scope 3 inventories\n \u2022Appendix C, which describes how to create a data management plan Source: Table 5.4 from the Scope 3 StandardTechnical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [11] \nIntroductionSelecting calculation methods\nFor most scope 3 categories, this document offers multiple calculation methods. Within each section, the calculation \nmethods are ranked in order of specificity,1 from most to least specific to a company\u2019s actual activities. In general, more \nspecific methods yield higher quality scope 3 emissions data whereas less specific methods yield lower quality scope \n3 emissions data. However, the more specific methods are often more time and labor intensive. The best method for \neach category depends on factors described below. \nCompanies should select calculation methods for each scope 3 activity within a category based on the following criteria:\n \u2022The relative size of the emissions from the scope 3 activity \n \u2022The company\u2019s business goals (see chapter 2 of the Scope 3 Standard)\n \u2022Data availability \n \u2022Data quality\n \u2022The cost and effort required to apply each method\n \u2022Other criteria identified by the company.\nCompanies should select calculation methods that ensure that the inventory appropriately reflects the GHG emissions \nof the activities and serves the decision-making needs of users, both internal and external to the company.\nNote that each scope 3 category may contain multiple activities (for example air travel and road travel could be \ntwo different activities within category 6, Business travel). If appropriate, different calculation methods can be \nused to calculate emissions from different activities within a category. This guide uses the term \u201cshould\u201d to indicate \nrecommendations for calculations.\nCompanies are required to report a description of the methodologies used to calculate emissions for each scope 3 \ncategory (see chapter 9 of the Scope 3 Standard). \nScreening to prioritize data collection\nThe Scope 3 Standard recommends that companies identify which scope 3 activities are expected to have the most \nsignificant GHG emissions, offer the most significant GHG reduction opportunities, and are most relevant to the \ncompany\u2019s business goals. Companies should begin by conducting a screening process, using less specific data, to \ndetermine the size of GHG emissions in each of the 15 categories. Then each category can be examined to determine \nwhether to further refine its emission estimates. \nThis document offers guidance on how to decide which categories require a more precise, and often more labor-intensive, \nmethod of data collection, and which might be adequately served by a less precise method. In most cases, the categories \nthat generate the largest amount of emissions should receive the most precise data collection treatment, however, \nsome smaller categories that are important to customers or employees may benefit from more precise treatment as \nwell. Categories most relevant to the company\u2019s business goals may also receive more attention. The business goals most frequently cited by companies as reasons for developing a scope 3 inventory were to: (1) identify and understand the risks \nand opportunities associated with value chain emissions; (2) identify GHG reduction opportunities, set reduction targets, \nand track performance; and (3) engage value chain partners in GHG management. See chapter 2 of the Scope 3 Standard. \n1  If a calculation method is specific to a compan y\u2019s activity, the calculation is based on data relating directly to the particular activity in \nquestion, such as data collected from a transport provider relating to journeys carried out. In contrast, less specific methods use data that \ndoes not directly relate to the activity, such as industry average emission factors.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [12] \nIntroductionCollecting higher quality data for priority activities allows companies to focus resources on the most significant GHG \nemissions in the value chain, more effectively set reduction targets, and track and demonstrate GHG reductions over time. \nAs a result of the screening, a company might decide that, in addition to using more precise data for activities with the \nmost emissions, it will seek higher quality data for activities that present the most significant risks and opportunities in the value chain, and for activities where more accurate data can be easily obtained. Conversely, it may choose to rely \non relatively less accurate data for activities that are expected to have insignificant emissions or where accurate data is \ndifficult to obtain.\nTo start the screening, a company can apply the criteria in table II to each of the 15 categories to find out where the \nbulk of its scope 3 GHG emissions occur. Note that to facilitate the initial screening, companies can use the less specific \ncalculation methods listed for each category (i.e., the methods at the bottom of the decision trees). See section 7.1 of \nthe Scope 3 Standard for more guidance on prioritizing data collection efforts. More specific methods can be applied \nlater to priority categories.  \nTable [II] Criteria for identifying relevant scope 3 activities \nCriteria Description of activities\nSize They contribute significantly to the company\u2019s total anticipated scope 3 emissions\nInfluence There are potential emissions reductions that could be undertaken or influenced\nby the company\nRisk They contribute to the company\u2019s risk exposure (e.g., climate change related risks such as financial, regulatory, supply chain, product and technology, compliance/litigation, and \nreputational risks)\nStakeholders They are deemed critical by key stakeholders (e.g., customers, suppliers, investors  \nor civil society)\nOutsourcing They are outsourced activities previously performed in-house or activities outsourced by the reporting company that are typically performed in-house by other companies in the reporting company\u2019s sector\nSector guidance They have been identified as significant by sector-specific guidance\nSpending or  revenue analysisThey are areas that require a high level of spending or generate a high level of revenue (and are sometimes correlated with high GHG emissions)\nOther They meet any additional criteria developed by the company or industry sector\nSource: Adapted from table 6.1 from the Scope 3 StandardTechnical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [13] \nIntroductionUsing a combination of calculation methods\nCompanies may use a combination of calculation methods for various scope 3 categories throughout the inventory, \nas well as for various scope 3 activities within each scope 3 category. For example, within each scope 3 category, a \ncompany may use more specific methods for the activities that contribute most to emissions and less specific methods \nfor the activities that contribute least to emissions. \nCompanies should take practical approaches to reduce costs and complexity without overly compromising quality. \nThese may include:\n \u2022Applying more accurate data/calculations for large contributors\n \u2022Applying less accurate data/calculations for small contributors\n \u2022Grouping or combining similar activity data (e.g., goods and services) \n \u2022Obtaining data from representative samples and extrapolating the results to the whole\n \u2022Using proxy techniques. \nExample: Using a combination of calculation methods\nA coffee company purchased coffee beans from 100 different suppliers in the reporting year. If 10 of these \nsuppliers account for 85 percent of the quantity of purchased beans, the company may decide to calculate emissions associated with the coffee beans from these 10 suppliers using primary data collected from the suppliers, either using the \u201csupplier-specific method\u201d or the \u201chybrid method\u201d (see chapter 1 for descriptions of the calculation methods for scope 3 category 1). The company may then choose to extrapolate to 100 percent based on the 85 percent of the beans for which data was collected.\nThe company spent a total of $20 million on purchasing coffee beans. The company also purchased a small \nquantity of sugar, totaling $1 million for the year. As the sugar only accounts for a small proportion of the company\u2019s total expenditure, the company may choose not to engage with the sugar suppliers, but instead use secondary emission factors, using either the \u201caverage-data method\u201d or the \u201cspend-based method.\u201d \nSignificance of an activity\u2019s emission contribution to the inventory is a key consideration when determining the \nappropriate level of data specificity to calculate the emissions.\nOverview of data types\nCalculating emissions requires the use of two types of data: activity data and emission factors. \n\u201cActivity data\u201d is a quantitative measure of a level of activity that results in GHG emissions (for example, liters of fuel \nconsumed, or kilograms of material purchased). An \u201cemission factor\u201d is a factor that converts activity data into GHG emissions data (for example kg CO\n2 emitted per liter of fuel consumed, or kg CO2 emitted per kilograms of material \nproduced). More examples of activity data and emission factors are provided in table 7.2 in the Scope 3 Standard.\nCompanies are required to report a description of the types and sources of activity data and emission factors used to \ncalculate the inventory (see chapter 11 in the Scope 3 Standard).Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [14] \nIntroductionMaterial/product emission factors in scope 3 accounting\nTwo types of emission factors can be used for calculating emissions associated with a material or product:\n \u2022Life cycle emission factors, which include emissions that occur at every stage of a material/product\u2019s life, from raw \nmaterial acquisition or generation of natural resource to end of life\n \u2022Cradle-to-gate (sometimes referred to as \u201cupstream\u201d) emission factors, which include all emissions that occur in the life cycle of a material/product up to the point of sale by the producer.\nIn general, cradle-to-gate emission factors should be used to calculate emissions associated with goods or services (e.g. category 1 (Purchased goods and services) and category 2 (Capital goods). \nEnergy emission factors in scope 3 accounting\nTwo types of emission factors are used to convert energy activity data into emissions data: \n \u2022Life cycle emission factors, which include not only the emissions that occur from combusting the fuel, but all other emissions that occur in the life cycle of the fuel such as emissions from extraction, processing, and transportation \n \u2022Combustion emission factors, which include only the emissions that occur from combusting the fuel. \nCompanies should use life cycle emission factors to calculate scope 3 emissions related to fuels and energy consumed in the reporting company\u2019s value chain, except for category 3 (Fuel- and energy-related activities not included in scope 1 or scope 2). Combustion emission factors are used to calculate scope 1 emissions (in the case of fuels) and scope 2 \nemissions (in the case of electricity).\nTwo activities within scope 3 category 3 require special consideration when selecting emission factors: \n \u2022Upstream emissions of purchased fuels (i.e., extraction, production, and transportation of fuels consumed by the \nreporting company) \n \u2022Upstream emissions of purchased electricity (i.e., extraction, production, and transportation of fuels consumed in the generation of electricity, steam, heating, and cooling that is consumed by the reporting company). \nTo calculate emissions from these two activities, companies should use emission factors that include upstream emissions (i.e., extraction, production, and transportation) but exclude emissions from combustion, since emissions \nfrom combustion are accounted for in scope 1 (in the case of fuels), in scope 2 (in the case of electricity), and in a \nseparate memo item (in the case of direct CO\n2 emissions from combustion of biomass or biofuels). See Chapter 3 of the \nScope 3 Standard. \nThese emission factors that exclude combustion are referred to as \u201cupstream emission factors,\u201d since they include all \nlife cycle stages of the fuel up to but excluding the final stage \u2013 combustion.\nApplicable greenhouse gases and global warming potential values \nFor each of the 15 scope 3 categories, companies are required to calculate emissions of all the GHGs required by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)/Kyoto Protocol at the time the inventory is \nbeing compiled. National reporting guidelines under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol require that specific GHGs \nbe included in national GHG emissions inventories. To remain consistent with national inventory practices, the GHG \nProtocol requires that these same GHGs also be reported in corporate GHG emissions inventories. Originally, the \nrequirements of the UNFCCC/Kyoto Protocol, and therefore of the GHG Protocol, were limited to a set of six individual \nGHGs or classes of GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO\n2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), \nperfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). However, changes to international accounting and reporting rules \nunder the UNFCCC/Kyoto Protocol now also require the reporting of another GHG, nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [15] \nIntroductionAs the Scope 3 Standard was released before NF3 was added to the list of GHGs covered by UNFCCC/Kyoto Protocol, \nreporting NF3 was not originally included as a requirement in the Scope 3 Standard. However an amendment has been \npublished on the GHG Protocol website (http://www.ghgprotocol.org/) which supersedes the original requirements of \nthe Scope 3 Standard and it is now a requirement that NF3 be included.\nIn this document, carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions represent emissions of all greenhouse gases, aggregated \nand converted to units of CO2e using global warming potential (GWP) values. \nGWP values describe the radiative forcing impact (or degree of harm to the atmosphere) of one unit of a given GHG \nrelative to one unit of carbon dioxide. GWP values convert GHG emissions data for non-CO2 gases into units of CO2e. \nCompanies may either use the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) GWP values agreed to by United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) or the most recent GWP values published by the IPCC. GWP values should be based on a 100-year time horizon. See section 7.2 of the Scope 3 Standard for more information \non GWP values. Companies are required to disclose the source of GWP values used to calculate the inventory (see \nchapter 11 of the Scope 3 Standard). \nPrimary data and secondary data \nCompanies may use either primary or secondary data to calculate scope 3 emissions. Table III provides definitions of these types of data.\nTable [III] Types of data\nData type Description\nPrimary Data Data from specific activities within a company\u2019s value chain\nSecondary Data Data that is not from specific activities within a company\u2019s value chain\n Source: Table 7.4 from the Scope 3 Standard.\nPrimary data includes data provided by suppliers or others that directly relate to specific activities in the reporting \ncompany\u2019s value chain. \nSecondary data includes industry-average-data (e.g., from published databases, government statistics, literature \nstudies, and industry associations), financial data, proxy data, and other generic data. In certain cases, companies may \nuse specific data from one activity in the value chain to estimate emissions for another activity in the value chain. This \ntype of data (i.e., proxy data) is considered secondary data, since it is not specific to the activity whose emissions are \nbeing calculated.\nSee table 7.4 in the Scope 3 Standard for examples of primary and secondary data by scope 3 category.\nCollecting primary data\nPrimary activity data may be obtained through meter readings, purchase records, utility bills, engineering models, \ndirect monitoring, mass balance, stoichiometry, or other methods for obtaining data from specific activities in the \ncompany\u2019s value chain. Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [16] \nIntroductionIf possible, companies should collect energy or emissions data from suppliers and other value chain partners to obtain \nsite-specific data for priority scope 3 categories and activities (see \u201cScreening to prioritize data collection,\u201d above, for \nguidance on identifying priority categories). To do so, companies should identify relevant suppliers from which to seek \nGHG data. Suppliers may include contract manufacturers, materials and parts suppliers, capital equipment suppliers, \nfuel suppliers, third-party logistics providers, waste management companies, and other companies that provide goods \nand services to the reporting company. \nIn general, companies should seek activity data or emissions data from suppliers that are as specific as possible to the \nproduct purchased from the supplier, following the hierarchy in table IV.\nTable [IV] Levels of data (ranked in order of specificity)\nData Type Description \nProduct-level data Cradle-to-gate GHG emissions for the product of interest \nActivity-, process-,  \nor production line-level data GHG emissions and/or activity data for the activities, processes, o r production \nlines that produce the product of interest \nFacility-level data GHG emissions and/or activity data for the facilities or operations th at produce \nthe product of interest \nBusiness-unit-level data GHG emissions and/or activity data for the business units that pro duce the  \nproduct of interest \nCorporate-level data GHG emissions and/or activity data for the entire corporation \n \nSource: Table 7.7 from the Scope 3 Standard.\nFor more information on collecting primary data and guidance on issues such as how to treat the confidentiality \nconcerns of suppliers, refer to section 7.4 of the Scope 3 Standard. \nCollecting secondary data \nWhen using secondary databases, companies should prefer those that are internationally recognized, provided by \nnational governments, or peer-reviewed. Companies can use the data-quality indicators in section 7.3 of the Scope \n3 Standard to select the secondary data sources that are the most complete, reliable, and representative to the \ncompany\u2019s activities in terms of technology, time, and geography. \nSecondary data sources can cover different stages in the value chain. Care should be taken to understand the \nboundaries covered by the data to minimize the potential for double counting errors across the value chain. \nThe secondary data sources included in the calculation resources of each category are examples and not an exhaustive \nlist. The GHG Protocol website has a more comprehensive list of secondary data sources at:  http://www.ghgprotocol.\norg/Third-Party-Databases. \nFor additional guidance on prioritizing data collection efforts, selecting data, collecting data, and filling data gaps, see \nchapter 7 of the Scope 3 Standard.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [17] \nIntroductionEnvironmentally-extended input output (EEIO) data\nEnvironmentally-extended input output (EEIO) models estimate energy use and/or GHG emissions resulting from the \nproduction and upstream supply chain activities of different sectors and products in an economy. The resulting EEIO \nemissions factors can be used to estimate cradle-to-gate GHG emissions for a given industry or product category. EEIO data \nare particularly useful in screening emissions sources when prioritizing data collection efforts. EEIO models are derived by \nallocating national GHG emissions to groups of finished products based on economic flows between industry sectors. \nThe output of EEIO models is typically a quantity of GHGs emitted per unit of revenue in a particular industry sector. For \nexample, an EEIO model may estimate that the sector \u201cpaper mills\u201d emits 1,520 tonnes CO2e per $1 million revenue, \nmeaning that, on average, 1,520 tonnes of CO2e are emitted during all upstream supply chain activities associated with \ngenerating $1 million revenue from that sector.\nThe advantages of EEIO data include:\n \u2022Comprehensive coverage of the entire economy (i.e., no emissions sources are excluded from the system boundary)\n \u2022Simplicity of method and application\n \u2022Time and cost savings as data requirements are less onerous than in a process-based approach.\nThe disadvantages of EEIO data include:\n \u2022Broad sector averages may not represent nuances of unique processes and products, especially for non-\nhomogenous sectors \n \u2022Assumption of linear attribution between monetary and environmental flows provides only indicative results (i.e., EEIO models cannot distinguish between products of different monetary value within a single sector)\n \u2022Lacks specificity and accuracy of process-based approaches \n \u2022Difficult to measure and demonstrate results of reduction efforts\n \u2022EEIO databases are generally limited to a specific geographic region, (e.g., United States) and are not available in some world regions.\nProcess-based data\nProcess-based data is derived from assessing all the known energy and environmental inputs of a particular process and calculating the direct emissions associated with the outputs of the process.\u00a0It is particularly applicable for unique \nprocesses and individual product level analysis.\nThe advantages of process-based data include:\n \u2022High level of specificity and focus\n \u2022Detailed analysis and possibility of unique insights to particular processes \n \u2022Straightforward concept. \nThe disadvantages of process based data include:\n \u2022Collection of data may be time, cost, and labor intensive\n \u2022Lack of comparability as the system boundary and the data are selected by the practitioner\n \u2022Data requirements may render large-scale, multi-product analysis impractical.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [18] \nIntroductionCombining EEIO and process-based data\nCompanies may combine the top down EEIO approach with the bottom-up, process-based approach to leverage the \nbenefits of both approaches.\u00a0For example, the upstream emissions of purchased goods could be calculated using an EEIO \napproach, whereas downstream emissions from use and end-of-life could be calculated using a process-based approach.\nCompanies are required to report a description of the types and sources of data used to calculate emissions for each \nscope 3 category (see chapter 11 of the Scope 3 Standard). \nUsing proxy data to fill data gaps\nCompanies should use the guidance in section 7.3 of the Scope 3 Standard, \u201cGuidance for selecting data\u201d to assess the \nquality of available data. If data of sufficient quality are not available, companies may use proxy data to fill data gaps. \nProxy data is data from a similar activity that is used as a stand-in for the given activity. Proxy data can be extrapolated, \nscaled up, or customized to be more representative of the given activity (e.g., partial data for an activity can be \nextrapolated or scaled up to represent 100 percent of the activity). \nIf a large company has access to 80 out of 100 manufacturing facilities it can extrapolate this information to fill the gap. \nIt would first group the activity data by similar characteristics, such as facility type or location, then calculate an intensity \nratio for a group of facilities where data is available (e.g., quantity of emissions per unit of production output). This \nfigure can then be applied to the unknown facilities in that group.\nSection 7.5 of the Scope 3 Standard \u201cGuidance for collecting secondary data and filling data gaps\u201d provides more \ninformation on the use of proxy data and its advantages and disadvantages. \nIf data are unavailable for a large number of sites or if a company needs to collect a large quantity of data for a scope \n3 category, but finds it impractical or impossible to collect data from each individual activity, the company may use \nappropriate sampling techniques to extrapolate data from a representative sample of activities. See Appendix A for \nguidance on sampling methods.\nImproving data quality over time\nCollecting data, assessing data quality, and improving data quality is an iterative process. When selecting data sources, \ncompanies should first apply data quality indicators and assess data quality, then review the quality of the collected \ndata, using the same data quality assessment approach. In their initial years of scope 3 data collection, companies may \nneed to use data of relatively low quality due to limited availability. Over time, companies should seek to improve \nthe data quality of the inventory by replacing lower quality data with higher quality data as it becomes available. In \nparticular, companies should prioritize data quality improvement for activities that have: \n \u2022Relatively low data quality\n \u2022Relatively high emissions. \nCompanies are required to provide a description of the data quality of reported scope 3 emissions data to ensure transparency and avoid misinterpretation of data (see chapter 11 of the Scope 3 Standard). Refer to section 7.3 for guidance on describing data quality; Appendix B for guidance on uncertainty; and section 9.3 for guidance on \nrecalculating base year emissions when making improvements in data quality over time.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [19] \nIntroductionIt is unlikely that all of a company\u2019s relevant suppliers will be able to provide it with GHG inventory data. (See table 7.8 \nof the Scope 3 Standard for a list of challenges and guidance for collecting primary data from suppliers.) In such cases, \ncompanies should encourage suppliers to develop GHG inventories in the future and may communicate their efforts to \nencourage more suppliers to provide GHG emissions data in the public report.\nIf changes in data quality result in significant differences in emissions estimates, companies are required to recalculate \nbase year emissions applying the new data sources. Refer to page 106 of the Scope 3 Standard for guidance on base \nyear recalculations for improvements in data accuracy over time. Appendix C of the Scope 3 Standard also provides a \nuseful resource for developing a data management plan and improving data management.\nGHG Protocol publications and tools\nSeveral GHG publications and calculation tools offer help in calculating emissions from various scope 3 categories. In particular, several cross-sector and sector-specific calculation tools available on the GHG Protocol website (http://www.\nghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools ) provide step-by-step guidance together with electronic worksheets to help \ncompanies calculate GHG emissions from specific sources or sectors.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [20] \n1Category 1:  \nPurchased Goods and Services\nCategory description\nThis category includes all upstream (i.e., cradle-to-gate) emissions from the production \nof products purchased or acquired by the reporting company in the reporting year. \nProducts include both goods (tangible products) and services (intangible products). \nCategory 1 includes emissions from all purchased goods and services not otherwise included in the other categories \nof upstream scope 3 emissions (i.e., category 2 through category 8). Specific categories of upstream emissions are \nseparately reported in category 2 through category 8 to enhance the transparency and consistency of scope 3 reports. \nEmissions from the transportation of purchased products from a tier one (direct) supplier to the reporting company (in \nvehicles not owned or controlled by the reporting company) are accounted for in category 4 (Upstream transportation \nand distribution).\nCompanies may find it useful to differentiate between purchases of production-related products (e.g., materials, \ncomponents, and parts) and non-production-related products (e.g., office furniture, office supplies, and IT support). This \ndistinction may be aligned with procurement practices and therefore may be a useful way to more efficiently organize \nand collect data (see box 5.2 of the Scope 3 Standard).\nSummary of methods for calculating emissions from purchased goods and services\nCompanies may use the methods listed below to calculate scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services. The first two methods \u2013 supplier-specific and hybrid \u2013 require the reporting company to collect data from the suppliers, whereas the \nsecond two methods \u2013 average-data and spend-based \u2013 use secondary data (i.e. industry average data). These methods are \nlisted in order of how specific\n2 the calculation is to the individual supplier of a good or service. However, companies need \nnot always use the most specific method as a first preference (see figure 1.1 and box 1.1). \n2 See Bo x 1.1 for further explanation of the data specificity and data accuracy1Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [21] \nCATEGORY 1 Purchased Goods and Services \u2022Supplier-specific method \u2013 collects product-level cradle-to-gate GHG inventory data from goods or services suppliers.\n \u2022Hybrid method \u2013 uses a combination of supplier-specific activity data (where available) and secondary data to fill \nthe gaps. This method involves:\n \u2022collecting allocated scope 1 and scope 2 emission data directly from suppliers;\n \u2022calculating upstream emissions of goods and services from suppliers\u2019 activity data on the amount of materials, fuel, electricity, used, distance transported, and waste generated from the production of goods and services and \napplying appropriate emission factors; and\n \u2022using secondary data to calculate upstream emissions wherever supplier-specific data is not available.\n \u2022Average-data method \u2013 estimates emissions for goods and services by collecting data on the mass (e.g., kilograms \nor pounds), or other relevant units of goods or services purchased and multiplying by the relevant secondary (e.g., \nindustry average) emission factors (e.g., average emissions per unit of good or service).\n \u2022Spend-based method \u2013 estimates emissions for goods and services by collecting data on the economic value of \ngoods and services purchased and multiplying it by relevant secondary (e.g., industry average) emission factors (e.g., \naverage emissions per monetary value of goods).\nFigure [1.1] Different data types used for different calculation methods\nSupplier-specific data or average  \ndata, or a combination of bothSupplier-specific data Supplier-specific data\nAverage data Average data\nAverage data Average dataAll other upstream emissions  \nfrom production of product\nSupplier-specific method\nHybrid method\nAverage-data method\nSpend-based methodAll data is specific to the \nsupplier\u2019s product\nScope 1 & 2 data specific to \nsupplier\u2019s product, all other \nupstream emissions either \nsupplier specific or average\nAll emissions are based on \nsecondary process data\nAll emissions are based on \nsecondary EEIO dataSupplier-specific dataSupplier\u2019s scope  \n1 & 2 emissions\nCalculation \nMethodNotes on \ndata used1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n10 11 12\n13 14 15\n16 171. wheat\n2. tree3. mountains4. glass bottle5. plastic bottle6. aluminium can7. factory8. lorry9. cloud10. recycling bin11. recycling bin (colours         reversed)12. wind turbines13. chicken14. cow 115. cow 216. shop17. factory showing carbon       emissions (carbon          emissions are shown in       orange) 1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n10 11 12\n13 14 15\n16 171. wheat\n2. tree3. mountains4. glass bottle5. plastic bottle6. aluminium can7. factory8. lorry9. cloud10. recycling bin11. recycling bin (colours         reversed)12. wind turbines13. chicken14. cow 115. cow 216. shop17. factory showing carbon       emissions (carbon          emissions are shown in       orange) \n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n10 11 12\n13 14 15\n16 171. wheat\n2. tree3. mountains4. glass bottle5. plastic bottle6. aluminium can7. factory8. lorry9. cloud10. recycling bin11. recycling bin (colours         reversed)12. wind turbines13. chicken14. cow 115. cow 216. shop17. factory showing carbon       emissions (carbon          emissions are shown in       orange) 1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n10 11 12\n13 14 15\n16 171. wheat\n2. tree3. mountains4. glass bottle5. plastic bottle6. aluminium can7. factory8. lorry9. cloud10. recycling bin11. recycling bin (colours         reversed)12. wind turbines13. chicken14. cow 115. cow 216. shop17. factory showing carbon       emissions (carbon          emissions are shown in       orange) 1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n10 11 12\n13 14 15\n16 171. wheat\n2. tree3. mountains4. glass bottle5. plastic bottle6. aluminium can7. factory8. lorry9. cloud10. recycling bin11. recycling bin (colours         reversed)12. wind turbines13. chicken14. cow 115. cow 216. shop17. factory showing carbon       emissions (carbon          emissions are shown in       orange) \nProduct life cycle stagesTechnical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [22] \nCATEGORY 1 Purchased Goods and ServicesCollecting data directly from suppliers adds considerable time and cost burden to conducting a scope 3 inventory, so \ncompanies should first carry out a screening (see Introduction, \u201cScreening to prioritize data collection\u201d) to prioritize \ndata collection and decide which calculation method is most appropriate to achieve their business goals.\nBox [1.1] The difference between data specificity and data accuracy\nEven though the supplier-specific and hybrid methods are more specific to the individual supplier than the average-data \nand spend-based methods, they may not produce results that are a more accurate reflection of the product\u2019s contribution to the reporting company\u2019s scope 3 emissions.  In fact, data collected from a supplier may actually be less accurate than industry-average data for a particular product. Accuracy derives from the granularity of the emissions data, the reliability of the supplier\u2019s data sources, and which, if any, allocation techniques were used. The need to allocate the supplier\u2019s emissions to the specific products it sells to the company can add a considerable degree of uncertainty, depending on the allocation methods used (for more information on allocation, see chapter 8 of the Scope 3 Standard). \nFigure 1.2 provides a decision tree to help companies determine the most appropriate calculation method for \nestimating their category 1 emissions. Companies may use different calculation methods for different types of \npurchased goods and services within category 1. For example, they can use more specific methods for categories of \ngoods and services that contribute the most to total emissions. The choice of calculation method depends on several \nfactors outlined in the Introduction, including the company\u2019s business goals, the significance (relative to total emissions) \nof goods and services within category 1, the availability of data, and the quality of available data. See sections 7.3 and \n7.4 of the Scope 3 Standard for guidance on assessing data quality.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [23] \nCATEGORY 1 Purchased Goods and ServicesFigure [1.2] Decision tree for selecting a calculation method for emissions from purchased goods and services\n \nNote * Companies should collect data of sufficient quality to ensure that the inventory:\n\u2022 most appropriately reflects the GHG emissions of the company\u2022 supports the company\u2019s business goals for conducting a GHG inventory\u2022 serves the decision-making needs of users, both internal and external to the company.

This information will provide \ntransparency around how much primary data the supplier used to calculate the emission factor for its product. As \nsuppliers become more sophisticated in GHG assessments, the percentage of primary data used to calculate emissions factors for their products is likely to increase. Collecting information on the ratio of primary and secondary data will \nenable this ratio to be measured and tracked over time.\nCalculation formula [1.1] Supplier-specific method\nCO2e emissions for purchased goods or services = \nsum across purchased goods or services:\n\u2211 (quantities of good purchased (e.g., kg)\n\u00d7 supplier-specific product emission factor of purchased good or service (e.g., kg CO2e/kg))Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [25] \nCATEGORY 1 Purchased Goods and ServicesExample [1.1] Calculating emissions from purchased goods and services using the supplier-specific method\nCompany A is a construction company that purchases materials for its operations. Using its internal IT system, Company \nA is able to determine the total weight (kg) purchased for each material. \nCompany A collects product-specific emission factors from the supplier for the purchased goods, which were produced \nas part of the suppliers\u2019 internal GHG inventory reports.\nNote: The activity data and emissions factors are illustrative only, and do not refer to actual data.  \nTotal emissions of purchased goods by Company A is calculated as follows:\n\u2211 (quantities of good purchased (e.g., kg)\n\u00d7 supplier -specific emission factor of purchased good or service (e.g., kg CO2e/kg))\n= (200,000 \u00d7 0.15) + (600,000 \u00d7 0.1) + (200,000 \u00d7 0.1) + (100,000 \u00d7 0.25) + (50,000 \u00d7 0.2)\n= 145,000 kg CO2e\nHybrid method\nActivity data needed\nFor each supplier, reporting companies should collect as much of the following activity data relating to the good or \nservice purchased as is available (if data is unavailable for certain activities, secondary data can be used to fill the gaps):\n \u2022Allocated scope 1 and scope 2 data (including emissions from electricity use and fuel use and any process and \nfugitive emissions). For guidance on allocating emissions, refer to chapter 8 of the Scope 3 Standard\n \u2022Mass or volume of material inputs (e.g., bill of materials), mass or volume of fuel inputs used, and distance from the origin of the raw material inputs to the supplier (the transport emissions from the supplier to the reporting company \nis calculated in category 4 so it should not be included here) \n \u2022Quantities of waste output other emissions. \nNote that, to the extent possible, the data provided by the supplier should be for the same time interval as the \nreporting company\u2019s scope 3 inventory and preference should be given to assured data.\nIf it is not feasible for the company to collect data from all its suppliers for all purchased goods, the company may use \nextrapolation and sampling techniques (see Appendix A).

In general, preference should be given to more specific and \nverified emission factors)\n \u2022Life cycle emission factors for fuel used by incoming transport of input materials to tier 1 supplier\n \u2022Emission factors for waste outputs by tier 1 suppliers to produce purchased goods\n \u2022Other emission factors as applicable (e.g., process emissions).\nThe secondary emission factors required will also depend on what data is available for the purchased good. Companies will need to collect either:\n \u2022Cradle-to-gate emission factors of the purchased goods or services per unit of mass or unit of product  \n(e.g., kg CO2e/kg or kg CO2e/hour spent)\n \u2022Cradle-to-gate emission factors of the purchased goods or services per unit of economic value (e.g., kg CO2e/$).\nData collection guidance\nTo combine the primary data collected from the supplier with secondary data (to fill the gaps), the secondary emission \nfactors must be disaggregated so the necessary elements can be overwritten with the supplier-specific data. For \nexample, if a company collects only scope 1, scope 2, and waste data from the supplier, all other upstream emissions \nneed to be estimated using secondary data (see example 1.3 below). \nThe reporting company may request the following information from suppliers to assist calculation: \n \u2022Internal data systems (e.g., bill of materials, freight distance of incoming raw materials) \n \u2022Public GHG inventory reports accessible through GHG reporting programs.\nData sources for emission factors include:\n \u2022The data sources on the GHG Protocol website (http://www.ghgprotocol.org/Third-Party-Databases ). Additional \ndatabases may be added periodically, so continue to check the website \n \u2022Company- or supplier-developed emission factors (e.g., if the supplier has conducted a reliable cradle-to-gate \nproduct GHG inventory or internal LCA report)\n \u2022Life cycle databases\n \u2022Industry associations\n \u2022Government agencies (e.g., Defra provides emission factors for the United Kingdom)\n \u2022For activity data, emission factors, and formulas for process and fugitive emissions, see the GHG Protocol website (http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools ) and the IPCC 2006 Guidelines (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.\nor.jp/public/2006gl/index.html).Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [27] \nCATEGORY 1 Purchased Goods and ServicesCalculation formula [1.2]   Hybrid method (where supplier -specific activity data is available for all activities \nassociated with producing the purchased goods) \nCO2e emissions for purchased goods and services = \nsum across purchased goods and services:\n\u2211 scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of tier 1 supplier relating to purchased good or service (kg CO2e)\n+ \nsum across material inputs of the purchased goods and services:\n\u2211 (mass or quantity of material inputs used by tier 1 supplier relating to purchased good or service (kg or unit)\n\u00d7 cradle-to-gate emission factor for the material (kg CO2e/kg or kg CO2e/unit))\n+\nsum across transport of material inputs to tier 1 supplier:\n\u2211 (distance of transport of material inputs to tier 1 supplier (km) \n\u00d7 mass or volume of material input (tonnes or TEUs) \n\u00d7 cradle-to-gate emission factor for the vehicle type (kg CO2e/tonne or TEU/km))\n+\nsum across waste outputs by tier 1 supplier relating to purchased goods and services:\n\u2211 (mass of waste from tier 1 supplier relating to the purchased good or service (kg)\n\u00d7 emission factor for waste activity (kg CO2e/kg))\n+\nother emissions emitted in provision of the good or service as applicable\nIf the supplier is not able to provide specific information about its goods or services sold to the company, it may be \nnecessary to allocate the emissions. For example, to calculate the sum of the waste outputs by the tier 1 supplier that \nrelate to the purchased goods, a company can allocate a proportion of the total waste from the supplier\u2019s operations to \nthe purchased product. Guidance on allocation can be found in chapter 8 of the Scope 3 Standard.\nExample [1.2] Calculating emissions from purchased goods using the hybrid method\nCompany A prints designs on t-shirts; it purchases the t-shirts from supplier B. Company A obtains the following \ninformation about supplier B\u2019s scope 1 and scope 2 emissions and waste generated, relating to the t-shirts sold to \nCompany A. Company A also obtains information regarding supplier B\u2019s material inputs relating to the t-shirts sold to \nCompany A and transport of these material inputs to supplier B.

This option may be desirable in cases where supplier engagement \nis part of a company\u2019s business goals for carrying out a scope 3 inventory, but where collecting all the data necessary \nto calculate a cradle-to-gate emission factor from supplier-specific activity data is not practical. It is likely that many suppliers will not be able to provide all the activity data listed, so this technique of combining some supplier-specific \ndata with secondary data is a possible alternative.\nCalculation formula 1.3 follows the same structure as calculation formula 1.2. The difference is that where data is \nunavailable for certain activities, secondary data (either process data or EEIO data) is used to fill the gaps. (See also \nfigure 1.1.). \nCalculation formula 1.3 shows an example in which only scope 1 and scope 2 data and waste data were collected from \nthe supplier, however, any combination of data could be collected from suppliers and the remaining data estimated \nusing secondary data in the same way.Example [1.2] Calculating emissions from purchased goods using the hybrid method (continued)Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [30] \nCATEGORY 1 Purchased Goods and ServicesCalculation formula [1.3]  Hybrid method (where only allocated scope 1 and scope 2 emissions and waste \ndata are available from supplier)\nCO2e emissions for a purchased good where the supplier can only provide scope 1 and scope 2 \nemissions data and waste generated in operations data = \nsum across purchased goods and services:\n\u2211 scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of tier 1 supplier relating to purchased good or service (kg CO2e)\n+\n\u2211 (mass of waste from tier 1 supplier relating to the purchased good (kg)\n\u00d7 emission factor for waste  activity (kg CO2e/kg))\n+\n\u2211 (mass or quantity of units of purchased good or service (kg) \n\u00d7 emission factor of purchased good excluding scope 1, scope 2, and emissions from waste generated by \nproducer (kg CO2e/kg or unit or $))\nExample [1.3]  Calculating emissions from a purchased good by using the hybrid method (where only allocated scope 1 and scope 2 emissions and waste data are available from supplier)\nUsing the same example, company A prints designs on t-shirts; it purchases the t-shirts from supplier B.

Company A has to estimate the upstream emissions of \nsupplier B using secondary data.

Emissions from the use of capital goods by the reporting company \nare accounted for in either scope 1 (e.g., for fuel use) or scope 2 (e.g., for electricity use), rather than in scope 3.\nCapital goods are final products that have an extended life and are used by the company to manufacture a product; \nprovide a service; or sell, store, and deliver merchandise. In financial accounting, capital goods are treated as fixed \nassets or as plant, property, and equipment (PP&E). Examples of capital goods include equipment, machinery, buildings, \nfacilities, and vehicles.\nIn certain cases, there may be ambiguity over whether a particular purchased product is a capital good (to be reported \nin category 2) or a purchased good (to be reported in category 1). Companies should follow their own financial \naccounting procedures to determine whether to account for a purchased product as a capital good in this category or \nas a purchased good or service in category 1. Companies should not double count emissions between category 1 and \ncategory 2. See box 2.1 for accounting for emissions from capital goods.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [37] \nCATEGORY 2 Capital GoodsBox [2.1] Accounting for emissions from capital goods\nIn financial accounting, capital goods (sometimes called \u201ccapital as sets\u201d) are typically depreciated or amortized over \nthe life of the asset. For purposes of accounting for scope 3 emissions, companies should not depreciate, discount, or \namortize the emissions from the production of capital goods over time. Instead companies should account for the total cradle-to-gate emissions of purchased capital goods in the year of acquisition, the same way the company accounts for emissions from other purchased products in category 1.

In some regions, electricity emission factors include life cycle activities related to electricity, such as transmission and distribution of electricity, or extraction, processing and transportation of fuels used to generate \nelectricity. Non-generation activities related to electricity are accounted for in scope 3, category 3 (Fuel- and energy-\nrelated activities not included in scope 1 or scope 2), rather than in scope 2. As a result, companies should seek (and \nemission factor developers should provide) transparent, disaggregated electricity emission factors that allow separate \naccounting of emissions from electricity generation in scope 2 and non-generation activities related to electricity in \nscope 3. Proper accounting creates consistency in scope 2 accounting and reporting among companies and avoids \ndouble counting of the same emission within scope 2 by more than one company.

The calculation tool \n(\u201cGHG emissions from transport or mobile sources\u201d) is available at the GHG Protocol website: http://www.ghgprotocol.\norg/calculation-tools/all-tools ). \nIt is important to note that the calculation tool was originally developed to calculate an organization\u2019s scope 1 emissions \n(i.e., emissions from vehicles that the organization owns and operates). Therefore, the emission factors that pre-\npopulate the calculation tool are combustion emission factors. When calculating emissions from transportation in \nscope 3, companies should use life cycle emission factors (see \u201cEnergy emission factors in scope 3 accounting\u201d  in the \nIntroduction for more information on which emission factors to use). If using the GHG Protocol transport calculation \ntool to calculate scope 3 emissions, companies should customize the tool by entering life cycle emission factors.\nFigure [4.1] Decision tree for selecting a calculation method for emissions from upstream transportation\nUse spend-based \ndata methodUse distance-  \nbased methodUse fuel-based \nmethod\nIs data available on the mass, distance  \nand mode of each shipment delivered  \nby transportation providers?

Companies may optionally calculate any emissions from unladen backhaul (i.e., the return \njourney of the empty vehicle).\nWhere fuel use data is unavailable, the company may derive fuel use by using the:\n \u2022Amount spent on fuels and the average price of fuels \n \u2022Distance travelled and the vehicle\u2019s fuel efficiency\n \u2022Amount spent on transportation services, fuel cost share (as percent of total cost of transportation services) and the \naverage price of fuels.\nFor calculating CO2, the fuel-based method is more accurate than the distance-based method because fuel \nconsumption is directly related to emissions. \nThe fuel-based method is best applied if the vehicle exclusively ships the reporting company\u2019s purchased goods (i.e., \nexclusive use or truckload shipping, rather than less-than-truckload (LTL) shipping). Otherwise, emissions should be \nallocated between goods shipped for the reporting company and goods shipped for other companies. See chapter 8 of \nthe Scope 3 Standard for further guidance on allocating emissions.\nCompanies should allocate emissions based on the following default limiting factors for each transportation mode, unless more accurate data is available to show that another factor is the limiting factor:\n \u2022Road transport: Truck capacity is typically limited by mass, so mass-based allocation should be used\n \u2022Marine transport: Vessel capacity is typically limited by volume, so volume-based allocation should be used\n \u2022Air transport: Aircraft capacity is typically limited by mass, so mass-based allocation should be used\n \u2022Rail transport: Rail capacity is typically limited by mass, so mass-based allocation should be used.\nIf there are multiple shipments on a transport leg, distance should also be used as a means for allocation. (For more information, see the Deutsche Post DHL example in this section.)\nIf data required for allocation is not available or reliable due to the variety of goods transported in one vehicle at the \nsame time, the distance-based method should be used to calculate scope 3 emissions. \nActivity data needed\nCompanies should collect data on:\n \u2022Quantities of fuel (e.g., diesel, gasoline, jet fuel, biofuels) consumed\n \u2022Amount spent on fuels\n \u2022Quantities of fugitive emissions (e.g., from air conditioning and refrigeration).\nIf applicable:\n \u2022Distance travelled\n \u2022Average fuel efficiency of the vehicle, expressed in units of liters of fuel consumed per tonne per kilometer \ntransported\n \u2022Cost of fuels\n \u2022Volume and/or mass of purchased goods in the vehicle\n \u2022Information on whether the products are refrigerated in transport.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [53] \nCATEGORY 4 Upstream Transportation and DistributionEmission factors needed\nCompanies should collect:\n \u2022Fuel emission factors, expressed in units of emissions per unit of energy consumed (e.g., kg CO2e/liters, CO2e/Btu)\n \u2022For electric vehicles (if applicable), electricity emission factors, expressed in units of emissions per unit of electricity consumed (e.g., kg CO\n2e/kWh)\n \u2022Fugitive emission factors, expressed in units of emissions per unit (e.g., kg CO2e/kg refrigerant leakage)\nEmission factors should at a minimum include emissions from fuel combustion, and should, where possible, include cradle-to-gate emissions of the fuel (i.e., from extraction, processing, and transportation to the point of use).\nNote: For air travel emission factors, multipliers or other corrections to account for radiative forcing may be applied to \nthe GWP of emissions arising from aircraft transport.

Tonne-kilometer is a unit of measure representing one tonne of goods transported \nover 1 kilometer. TEU-kilometer is a unit of measure representing one twenty-foot container equivalent of goods \ntransported over 1 kilometer.\nThe distance-based method is especially useful for an organization that does not have access to fuel or mileage records \nfrom the transport vehicles, or has shipments smaller than those that would consume an entire vehicle or vessel. \nIf sub-contractor fuel data cannot be easily obtained in order to use the fuel-based method, then the distance-based \nmethod should be used. Distance can be tracked using internal management systems or, if these are unavailable, online \nmaps. However, accuracy is generally lower than the fuel-based method as assumptions are made about the average \nfuel consumption, mass or volume of goods, and loading of vehicles.\nActivity data needed\nCompanies should collect data on the distance travelled by transportation suppliers. This data may be obtained by:\n \u2022Mass or volume of the products sold\n \u2022Actual distances provided by transportation supplier (if actual distance is unavailable, companies may use the shortest theoretical distance)\n \u2022Online maps or calculators\n \u2022Published port-to-port travel distances.\nThe actual distances should be used when available, and each leg of the transportation supply chain should be collected separately. \nEmission factors needed\nCompanies should collect:\n \u2022Emission factor by mode of transport (e.g., rail, air, road) or vehicle types (e.g., articulated lorry, container vessel), \nexpressed in units of greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4, N2O, or CO2e) per unit of mass (e.g., tonne) or volume (e.g., TEU) \ntravelled (e.g., kilometer). \nCommon forms of emission factors are kg CO2e/tonne/km for road transport or kg CO2e/TEU/km for sea transport. \nNote: For air travel emission factors, multipliers or other corrections to account for radiative forcing may be applied to the GWP of emissions arising from aircraft transport.

Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [61] \nCATEGORY 4 Upstream Transportation and DistributionTo calculate emissions, companies should multiply the quantity of goods purchased in mass (including packaging and \npallets) or volume by the distance travelled in the transport leg and then multiply that by an emission factor specific to \nthe transport leg (usually a transport mode- or vehicle type- specific emission factor). \nBecause each transport mode or vehicle type has a different emission factor, the transport legs should be calculated \nseparately and total emissions aggregated.\nThe following formula can be applied to all modes of transport and/or vehicle types to calculate emissions from \ntransportation: \nCalculation formula [4.6] Distance-based method (transportation)\nCO2e emissions from transportation = \nsum across transport modes and/or vehicle types:\n= \u2211 (mass of goods purchased (tonnes or volume ) \u00d7 distance travelled in transport leg (km)\n\u00d7 emission factor of transport mode or vehicle type (kg CO2e/tonne or volume/km)) Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [62] \nCATEGORY 4 Upstream Transportation and DistributionExample [4.2] Calculating emissions from upstream transportation using the distance-based method\nCompany A makes chairs and sources basic materials from Suppliers B, C, and D.

The choice of appropriate allocation \nfactors is a critical decision point to ensure fair allocation of emissions. The following example demonstrates a typical \nsituation, in which different allocation factors may lead to completely different results.\nThis example is about a typical delivery run where a truck needs to stop at different locations to pick up or drop off \nshipments. In this example, 24-tonne shipment 1 needs to be transported from a home station (A) to a customer (B). At customer (B), shipment 1 is unloaded and shipments 2 and 3 are picked up. Shipment 2 is addressed to customer (C) and \nshipment 3 needs to be transported back to the home station (A). \nData were not available on the type and quantity of fuel consumed during transportation, but data on the mass, \ndistance, and mode of shipment was available. Therefore the distance-based method was used. It was calculated that 31.5 kg CO\n2 was emitted during this delivery run. How can we allocate these emissions to the shipments?\nI. Allocation using driven-tonne kilometers\nOne option for allocation is to use driven-tonne kilometers (tkm) as an allocation factor. For calculating the tonne-\nkilometers, the weight of each shipment is multiplied by the distance driven. Then the total amount of CO2 emissions is \nallocated to the shipments on the basis of their share in the driven tonne- kilometers.\nShipment 1 Shipment 2 Shipment 3 Total\nDriven tkm 240 tkm 150 tkm 250 tkm 640 tkm\nTotal emissions 31.5 kg CO2\nAllocation factor 0.049 kg CO2 per tkm\nShipment emissions 11.8 kg CO27.4 kg CO212.3 kg CO231.5 kg CO215 km B C\n10 km\n10 km\nShipment 1\nOrigin: ADestination: BWeight 24 tShipment 2Origin: BDestination: CWeight 10 tShipment 3Origin: CDestination: AWeight 10 t\n123\n456\n789\n101112\n131415\n16171. wheat\n2. tree3. mountains4. glass bottle5. plastic bottle6. aluminium can7. factory8. lorry9. cloud10. recycling bin11. recycling bin (colours         reversed)12. wind turbines13. chicken14. cow 115. cow 216. shop17. factory showing carbon       emissions (carbon          emissions are shown in       orange) \nATechnical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [64] \nCATEGORY 4 Upstream Transportation and DistributionSurprisingly, shipment 2, which causes the longest transportation leg (15 km), receives minimum emissions and shipment \n3 is \u201cpunished\u201d for being transported jointly with shipment 2 via customer (C). The next option shows how such \ndownsides can be mitigated.\nII. Allocation using shortest theoretical distanceThe second option aims at allocating CO\n2 emissions using the shortest theoretical distance between the origin and \ndestination of each shipment (also known as the Great Circle Distance) as an allocation factor. The shipments\u2019 CO2 \nallocation is independent from the actual driven distance because that is of no relevance to the customer. As in the \nexample above, tonne-kilometers are calculated \u2013 this time using the shortest theoretical distance between a shipment\u2019s \norigin and destination \u2013 before performing the allocation.\nShipment 1 Shipment 2 Shipment 3 Total\nTkm based on GCD 240 tkm 150 tkm 100 tkm 490 tkm\nTotal emissions 31.5 kg CO2\nAllocation factor 0.064 kg CO2 per tkm\nShipment emissions 15.43 kg CO29.64 kg CO26.43 kg CO231.5 kg CO2\nBecause the allocation of emissions for individual items is based only on the characteristics of the individual shipments, this option provides a fair allocation method.\nAlthough there are many more options to perform the allocation to shipments in freight transport, this example \nillustrates pitfalls a user can encounter by picking an allocation factor.Example [4.3] Allocating emissions from transportation (Deutsche Post DHL) (continued)Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [65] \nCATEGORY 4 Upstream Transportation and DistributionSpend-based method\nIf the fuel-based method and distance method cannot be applied (e.g., due to data limitations), companies should \napply the spend-based method to calculate the emissions from transportation. In this method, the amount spent on \ntransportation by type is multiplied by the relevant EEIO emission factors. Refer to \u201cEnvironmentally-extended input \noutput (EEIO) data\u201d in the Introduction for guidance on EEIO data. Companies may determine the amount spent on \ntransportation through bills, invoice payments, or financial accounting systems.

If a company purchases a recycled material \nthat has lower upstream emissions than the equivalent virgin material then this would register as lower emissions \nin category 1. Under circumstance B, a company may recycle some of its \u201coperational waste\u201d. These emissions are \nreported under category 5 (Waste generated in operations). Under circumstance C, products with recyclable content \neventually become waste, which could be recycled. Emissions generated in this process are reported as category 12 \n(End-of-life treatment of sold products). (See figure 5.1.)\nBecause one company may both purchase recycled materials and sell recyclable products, methodologies have been \nestablished to keep the emissions from being double counted. To allocate the emissions from the recycling process between the disposer of the waste and the user of the recycled material, the recommended allocation method is \nthe \u201crecycled content method.\u201d This method allocates the emissions to the company that uses the recycled material \n(reported as category 1).\nIf there is doubt about which processes are allocated to the recycled material (circumstance A), it may be helpful to look \nat which processes are included in the cradle-to-gate emission factor for the material when it is used as an input. Any \nprocesses not included in that factor, but applicable to the company\u2019s supply chain, should be included in category 5 or \ncategory 12 because they have not been allocated to the recycled material. \nThe recycled content method is recommended for scope 3 inventories because it is easy to use and generally consistent \nwith secondary emission factors available for recycled material inputs. However, companies may use other methods \nif they are more applicable to specific materials in their supply chain. For example, the \u201cclosed loop approximation \nmethod\u201d may be applicable when a recycled material output has the same inherent properties as virgin material input into the same supply chain. This method, also defined in more detail in section 9.3.6 of the Product Standard, accounts \nfor the impact that end-of-life recycling has on the net virgin acquisition of a material. If there is uncertainty about \nwhich recycling method is appropriate for a given material or if the supply chain is complex, the recycled content \nmethod is the recommended choice to avoid double counting or miscounting of emissions. \nReporting negative or avoided emissions from recycling\nClaims of negative or avoided emissions associated with recycling are claims beyond a reduction in processing emissions \n(as described in circumstance A above) and beyond a reduction in waste treatment emissions in categories 5 or 12 Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [79] \nCATEGORY 5 Waste Generated in Operations(as described in circumstances B and C above). Negative or avoided emissions claims refer to a comparison of the \nemissions from processing the recycled material relative to the emissions from producing the equivalent virgin material.\nAny claims of avoided emissions associated with recycling should not be included in, or deducted from, the scope \n3 inventory, but may instead be reported separately from scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions. Companies that report avoided emissions should also provide data to support the claim that emissions were avoided (e.g., that recycled \nmaterials are collected, recycled, and used) and report the methodology, data sources, system boundary, time period, \nand other assumptions used to calculate avoided emissions. For more information on avoided emissions, see section 9.5 \nof the Scope 3 Standard (see also \u201cReporting additional metrics for recycling and waste-to-energy,\u201d below).\nFigure [5.1] Using the recycled content method to account for emissions from recycling \nCircumstance A:  Company A \npurchases material that contains \nrecycled content.

If a company purchases energy from the same facility that it sends its waste to, then accounting for emissions \nfrom the waste-to-energy combustion process both upstream and downstream would double count the emissions. To avoid \ndouble counting, a company should account for upstream emissions from purchased energy generated from waste in scope \n2. (In most cases, the emissions associated with combustion of waste to produce energy will be included in the grid average \nemission factor). Companies should account for emissions from preparing and transporting waste that will be combusted in \na waste-to-energy facility in category 5, but should not account for emissions from the waste-to-energy combustion process itself. These emissions should be included in scope 2 by the consumers of energy generated from waste.\nIf waste from operations is incinerated and used for energy on-site and under operational or financial control, the \nemissions associated with the incineration are included as scope 1 (and scope 2 would decrease as a result of a \nreduction in purchased energy). Companies should not report negative or avoided emissions associated with waste-to-\nenergy in the inventory. \nThis guidance does not apply to accounting for emissions from waste that is incinerated without energy recovery. All \nemissions from combusting waste without energy recovery are reported by the company generating the waste under \nscope 3, category 5 (Waste generated in operations). \nReporting additional information for recycling and waste-to-energy\nUnder the accounting methodology described above, emissions from recycling and waste-to-energy both appear \nto have a similar effect on the reporting company\u2019s scope 3 category 5 emissions (i.e., emissions from both will be \nreported as close to zero) based on the scope 3 boundary definition. It is, therefore, suggested that companies \nseparately report additional information to help identify the full GHG impacts within and outside their inventory \nboundary and make informed decisions about the best options for waste treatment (e.g. recycling compared to \nwaste-to-energy). \nIf electricity is generated from waste-to-energy, companies may report separately the emissions per unit of net electrical \ngeneration from the combustion stage of waste-to-energy relative to the local grid average  electricity emission factor \n(tonnes CO2e per kWh). For example incinerating plastic waste is likely to be more carbon-intensive per kWh of electricity \ngenerated than the grid average. Reporting this metric would help companies understand whether sending their waste to a waste-to-energy facility is leading to more- or less-carbon-intensive electricity for the region. \nSimilarly in the case of recycling, it is suggested that companies report separately the recycling emissions relative to the \nemissions from producing the equivalent virgin material. This number will often be a negative emissions figure (as recycled \nmaterial inputs generally have lower upstream emissions than virgin materials). If reported, this figure must be reported \nseparately to the scope 3 inventory.\nAccounting for emissions from wastewater\nEmissions from wastewater are highly variable depending on how much processing is needed to treat the water \n(determined by biological oxygen demand [BOD] and/or chemical oxygen demand [COD]). The following industries \noften have higher emissions from wastewater (where wastewater is not treated onsite): starch refining; alcohol \nrefining; pulp and paper; vegetables, fruits, and juices; and food processing. Companies in these industries should \ncalculate emissions from wastewater using methods provided in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas \nInventories Volume 5 Waste, available at http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol5.html.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [81] \n6\nCategory 6: \nBusiness Travel\nCategory description\nThis category includes emissions from the transportation of employees for business-\nrelated activities in vehicles owned or operated by third parties, such as aircraft, trains, buses, and passenger cars.\nEmissions from transportation in vehicles owned or controlled by the reporting company are accounted for in either \nscope 1 (for fuel use), or in the case of electric vehicles, scope 2 (for electricity use). Emissions from leased vehicles \noperated by the reporting company not included in scope 1 or scope 2 are accounted for in scope 3, category 8 \n(Upstream leased assets).

For guidance on calculating emissions using this method, refer to the guidance \nfor category 4 (Upstream transport and distribution). Companies may optionally collect data on the number of hotel \nnights incurred during business travel by hotel type. Under this method, they add the number of hotel nights and the \nemissions factor of the hotel (as shown in the distance-based method below) to the fuel-based method in category 4 \n(Upstream transport and distribution).\nDistance-based method\nIf data on fuel use is unavailable, companies may use the distance-based method. \nThe distance-based method involves multiplying activity data (i.e., vehicle-kilometers or person-kilometers travelled by \nvehicle type) by emission factors (typically default national emission factors by vehicle type). Vehicle types include all categories of aircraft, rail, subway, bus, automobile, etc. \nActivity data needed\nCompanies should collect data on:\n \u2022Total distance travelled by each mode of transport (air, train, bus, car, etc.) for employees in the reporting year.\nWhere possible, companies should also collect data on:\n \u2022Countries of travel (since transportation emission factors vary by country)\n \u2022Specific types of vehicles used for travel (since transportation emission factors vary by vehicle types)  \nfrom transport providers\n \u2022The specific passenger vehicle type and the relevant emission factor.\nCompanies may optionally collect data on the number of hotel nights incurred during business travel by hotel type. \nActivity data should be expressed as the number of kilometers travelled or kilometers travelled per person for a \nparticular vehicle type (e.g., passenger-kilometer). The activity data should be summed to obtain total annual kilometers \nor person-kilometers travelled by each vehicle type used by the company.\nEmission factors needed\nCompanies should collect:\n \u2022Emission factors for each mode of transport (e.g., aircraft, rail, metro, bus, taxi, bus), expressed in units of \ngreenhouse gas (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFC, or CO2e) emitted per kilometer or per passenger-kilometer travelled.\nCompanies may optionally use emission factors for hotel stays by hotel type (e.g., kilograms of CO2e emitted per hotel night).\nNote: For air travel emission factors, multipliers or other corrections to account for radiative forcing may be applied to the GWP of emissions arising from aircraft transport. If\u00a0applied, companies should disclose the specific factor used.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [84] \nCATEGORY 6 Business TravelData collection guidance\nMethods of data collection include:\n \u2022Automatic tracking of distance travelled by mode through a travel agency or other travel providers\n \u2022Automatic tracking of distance travelled by mode through internal expense and reimbursement systems,  \nwhich may require adding new questions on distance travelled and mode of transport to travel or expense forms \nsubmitted by employees\n \u2022Annual surveys/questionnaires of employees\n \u2022Working with travel providers (e.g., transportation companies, hotels) to obtain GHG emissions data. \nCollecting travel data from all employees may not be feasible. In such a case, companies may extrapolate from a \nrepresentative sample of employees to the total business travel of all employees. For example, a company may have 4,000 employees, each of whom has different travel profiles. The company may extrapolate from a representative \nsample of 400 employees to approximate the total business travel of all employees. Companies may also choose to \ngroup or combine data from business travellers with similar travel profiles.

Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [86] \nCATEGORY 6 Business Travel Three types of flights are identified for calculating emission factors. Short-haul flights have higher emission factors due \nto strong influence of the landing/take off cycle on emissions, whereas long-haul flights have slightly higher emissions \nthan medium-haul flights due to the additional weight of fuel. Many countries have specific definitions of types of \nflights. Below is an indicative description: \n \u2022Short haul \u2013 flights less than 3 hours in length \n \u2022Medium haul \u2013 flights 3-6 hours in length \n \u2022Long haul \u2013 journeys made by wide-bodied aircrafts that fly long distance, typically more than 6.5 hours.\ntotal business travel emissions of Company A can be calculated as follows:\nemissions from road travel = \u2211 (distance travelled by vehicle type (vehicle-km or passenger-km)\n\u00d7 vehicle specific emission factor (kg CO2e/vehicle-km or kg CO2e/passenger-km))\n= (10/2 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 1) + (20/2 \u00d7 200 \u00d7 2) + (100/3 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 4)\n= 17,583.33 kg CO2e\nemissions from air travel = \u2211 (distance travelled by vehicle type (vehicle-km or passenger-km) \n\u00d7 vehicle specific emission factor (kg CO2e/vehicle-km or kg CO2e/passenger-km))\n= (10 \u00d7 10,000 \u00d7 5) + (20 \u00d7 15,000 \u00d7 6) + (100 \u00d7 12,000 \u00d7 5)\n= 8,300,000 kg CO2e\ntotal emissions from employee travel = emissions from road travel + emissions from air travel\n= 17,583.33 + 8,300,000\n= 8,317,583.33 kg CO2e\nSpend-based method\nIf it is not possible to use either the fuel- or distance-based methods, companies may use the spend-based method. \nThe calculation method is same as the spend-based method described in Category 4: Upstream Transportation \nand Distribution, with the difference that the activity data is the amount spent on business travel by type/mode of \ntransport. Refer to the spend-based method in Category 4 for a description of this method.\nCompanies may optionally collect data on the number of hotel nights incurred during business travel by hotel type.Example [6.1] Calculating emissions from business travel using the distance-based method (continued)Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [87] \n7\nCategory 7: \nEmployee Commuting\nCategory description\nThis category includes emissions from the transportation of employees4 between their homes and their worksites. \nEmissions from employee commuting may arise from:\n \u2022Automobile travel\n \u2022Bus travel\n \u2022Rail travel\n \u2022Air travel\n \u2022Other modes of transportation (e.g., subway, bicycling, walking).\nCompanies may include emissions from teleworking (i.e., employees working remotely) in this category. \nA reporting company\u2019s scope 3 emissions from employee commuting include the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of \nemployees and third-party transportation providers.\nCalculating emissions from employee commuting\nFigure 7.1 offers a decision tree for selecting a calculation method for scope 3 emissions from employee commuting. \nCompanies may use one of the following methods:\n \u2022Fuel-based method, which involves determining the amount of fuel consumed during commuting and applying the appropriate emission factor for that fuel \n \u2022Distance-based method, which involves collecting data from employees on commuting patterns (e.g., distance travelled and mode used for commuting) and applying appropriate emission factors for the modes used\n \u2022Average-data method, which involves estimating emissions from employee commuting based on average  \n(e.g., national) data on commuting patterns.\n4 \u201cEmployees\u201d refers to employees of entities and facilities owne d, operated, or leased by the reporting company.

Where used, companies should disclose the specific factor used.\nData collection guidance\nCompanies should collect data on employee commuting habits, for example through a survey. Companies should survey their employees annually to obtain information on average commuting habits. Types of data to collect include: \n \u2022Distance travelled by employees per day, or location of residence and office\n \u2022The number of days per week that employees use different vehicle types (all categories of subway, car, bus, train, bicycle, etc.)\n \u2022Number of commuting days per week and number of weeks worked per year\n \u2022If the company is multinational: employees\u2019 region of residence/work (since transportation emission factors vary by region)\n \u2022Whether there is a significant car-pooling scheme in operation, the proportion of employees using the scheme and the average occupancy per vehicle \n \u2022If applicable, the amount of energy used from teleworking (e.g., kWh of gas, electricity consumed).\nCollecting commuting data from all employees through a survey may not be feasible. Companies may extrapolate from a representative sample of employees to represent the total commuting patterns of all employees. For example, a company with 4,000 employees, who each have different commuting profiles, may extrapolate from a representative \nsample of, for example, 1,000 employees to approximate the total commuting of all employees. See Appendix A for \nmore information on sampling.\nCalculation formula [7.1] Distance-based method\nCO2e emissions from employee travel =\nfirst, sum across all employees to determine total distance travelled using each vehicle type:\ntotal distance travelled by vehicle type (vehicle-km or passenger-km)\n= \u2211 (daily one-way distance between home and work (km) \u00d7 2 \u00d7 number of commuting days per year)\nthen, sum across vehicle types to determine total emissions:\nkg CO2e from employee commuting\n= \u2211 (total distance travelled by vehicle type (vehicle-km or passenger-km) \n\u00d7 vehicle specific emission factor (kg CO2e/vehicle-km or kg CO2e/passenger-km))\n+\n(optionally) for each energy source used in teleworking:\n\u2211 (quantities of energy consumed (kWh) \u00d7 emission factor for energy source (kg CO2e/kWh))Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [90] \nCATEGORY 7 Employee Commuting \n Companies should convert daily commuting distance into annual commuting distance by multiplying the daily distance \nby the number of times the trip occurs during the reporting period. For example, if a company collects distance data on \none-way journeys, the company should multiply the distance by the number of working days in the reporting year, and \nthen multiply by two to account for daily return journeys.\nDistance-travelled data by transport mode should be summed across all employees to obtain total annual kilometers or \npassenger-kilometers travelled by each mode of transport.\nCompanies may optionally calculate the emissions of teleworking from home. To calculate these emissions, a baseline \nemissions scenario should first be established. Baseline emissions occur regardless of whether or not the employee was at home (e.g., energy consumed by the refrigerator). The reporting company should only account for the additional \nemissions resulting from working from home, for example the electricity usage as a result of running the air conditioner \nto stay cool.\nExample [7.1] Calculating emissions from employee travel using the distance-based method\nCompany A is a small advertising services company, with three employees working 48 weeks per year.

For companies that own and lease assets to others (i.e., lessors), see category 13 (Downstream leased assets).\nLeased assets may be included in a company\u2019s scope 1 or scope 2 inventory depending on the type of lease and the \nconsolidation approach the company uses to define its organizational boundaries (see section 5.2 of the Scope 3 Standard).\nIf the reporting company leases an asset for only part of the reporting year, it should account for emissions for the portion of the year that the asset was leased. A reporting company\u2019s scope 3 emissions from upstream leased assets \ninclude the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of lessors (depending on the lessor\u2019s consolidation approach).\nSee Appendix A of the Scope 3 Standard for more information on accounting for emissions from leased assets.\nCalculating emissions from leased assets\nFigure 8.1 shows a decision tree for selecting a calculation method for emissions from upstream leased assets. \nCompanies may use one of the following methods:\n \u2022Asset-specific method, which involves collecting asset-specific (e.g., site-specific) fuel and energy use data and process and fugitive emissions data or scope 1 and scope 2 emissions data from individual leased assets\n \u2022Lessor-specific method, which involves collecting the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from lessor(s) and allocating emissions to the relevant leased asset(s)Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [95] \nCATEGORY 8 Upstream Leased Assets \u2022Average data method, which involves estimating emissions for each leased asset, or groups of leased assets, based \non average data, such as average emissions per asset type or floor space.\nCompanies may also calculate the life cycle emissions associated with manufacturing or constructing leased assets.\nFigure [8.1] Decision tree for selecting a calculation method for emissions from upstream leased assets\nAsset-specific method\nThis method involves collecting asset-specific (e.g., site-specific) fuel and energy and/or scope 1 and scope 2 emissions \ndata from individual leased assets.\nActivity data needed\nCompanies should collect scope 1 and scope 2 emissions data, or activity data on:\n \u2022Asset-specific fuel use and electricity, steam, heating and cooling use \n \u2022If applicable, activity data related to non-combustion emissions (i.e., industrial process or fugitive emissions). \nEmission factors needed\nCompanies should collect:\n \u2022Site or regionally specific emission factors for energy sources (e.g., electricity and fuels) per unit of consumption \n(e.g., kg CO2e/kWh for electricity, kg CO2e/liter for diesel)\n \u2022Emission factors of fugitive and process emissions.Use  average -  \ndata methodnoUse lessor-specific  \nmethodCan the lessor provide \nscope 1 and scope 2 \nemissions data, allocated to \nthe relevant leased asset?Use asset-specific  \nmethod\nno noIs asset-specific (e.g., \nsite-specific) fuel and \nenergy data or scope 1 \nand scope 2 emissions \ndata available? yes\nyesyesDoes the leased asset \ncontribute significantly to \nscope 3 emissions (based on \nscreening) or are emissions \nfrom leased assets \notherwise relevant to the \nbusiness goals?

Outbound transportation and distribution services \nthat are purchased by the reporting company are excluded from category 9 and included in category 4 (Upstream \ntransportation and distribution) because the reporting company purchases the service. Category 9 includes only \nemissions from transportation and distribution of products after the point of sale. See table 5.7 in the Scope 3 Standard  \nfor guidance in accounting for emissions from transportation and distribution in the value chain.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [103] \nCATEGORY 9 Downstream Transportation and DistributionFigure [9.1] Accounting for emissions from transportation and distribution of sold products\nEmissions from downstream transportation and distribution can arise from transportation/storage of sold products in \nvehicles/facilities not owned by the reporting company. For example:\n \u2022Warehouses and distribution centers\n \u2022Retail facilities\n \u2022Air transport\n \u2022Rail transport\n \u2022Road transport \n \u2022Marine transport.\nIn this category, companies may include emissions from customers traveling to and from retail stores, which can be significant for companies that own or operate retail facilities. See chapter 5.6 of the Scope 3 Standard for guidance on the applicability of category 9 to final products and intermediate products sold by the reporting company. A reporting \ncompany\u2019s scope 3 emissions from downstream transportation and distribution include the scope 1 and scope 2 \nemissions of transportation companies, distribution companies, retailers, and (optionally) customers.\nIf the reporting company sells an intermediate product, the company should report emissions from transportation and \ndistribution of this intermediate product between the point of sale by the reporting company and either (1) the end \nconsumer (if the eventual end use of the intermediate product is known) or (2) business customers (if the eventual end \nuse of the intermediate product is unknown).How to account for scope 3 \nemissions from transportation & \ndistribution of sold products...1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n10 11 12\n13 14 15\n16 171. wheat\n2. tree3. mountains4. glass bottle5. plastic bottle6. aluminium can7. factory8. lorry9. cloud10. recycling bin11. recycling bin (colours         reversed)12. wind turbines13. chicken14. cow 115. cow 216. shop17. factory showing carbon       emissions (carbon          emissions are shown in       orange) \n...if  the company does not pay for  \ntransportation of sold products to retailer\n...if  the company does pay for  \ntransportation of sold products to retailer1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n10 11 12\n13 14 15\n16 171. wheat\n2. tree3. mountains4. glass bottle5. plastic bottle6. aluminium can7. factory8. lorry9. cloud10. recycling bin11. recycling bin (colours         reversed)12. wind turbines13. chicken14. cow 115. cow 216. shop17. factory showing carbon       emissions (carbon          emissions are shown in       orange) \nReporting \nCompanyTransportation \nof sold productsRetailer Consumer\nScope 1 & 2 Scope 3 category 9 Scope 3 category 9\nScope 1 & 2 Scope 3 category 4 Scope 3 category 9Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [104] \nCATEGORY 9 Downstream Transportation and DistributionCalculating emissions from transportation (downstream)\nThe emissions from downstream transportation should follow the calculation methods described in category 4 \n(Upstream transportation and distribution). Figure 9.1 shows how to determine how to account for emissions from \ntransportation and distribution of sold products. Companies may use either the fuel-based, distance-based or spend-\nbased method. \nActivity data needed\nThe major difference between calculating upstream and downstream emissions of transportation is likely to be the availability and quality of activity data. Transportation data may be easier to obtain from upstream suppliers than from \ndownstream customers and transportation companies. Therefore, companies may need to use the distance-based \nmethod to calculate downstream transportation emissions. \nIf the actual transportation distances are not known, the reporting company may estimate downstream distances by \nusing a combination of:\n \u2022Government, academic, or industry publications \n \u2022Online maps and calculators\n \u2022Published port-to-port travel distances.\nEmission factors needed\n \u2022See emission factors guidance for category 4 (Upstream transportation and distribution).\nData collection guidanceThe UK government produces average freight distances for the economy\u2019s main categories of goods (see http://www.\ndft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/freight/). This database may be used in the absence of purchaser-\nspecific or region-specific data. \nA list of life cycle databases is provided on the GHG Protocol website (http://www.ghgprotocol.org/Third-Party-\nDatabases ). Additional databases may be added periodically, so continue to check the website.\nCalculating emissions from distribution (downstream)\nThe emissions from downstream distribution should follow the calculation methods described in category 4 (Upstream transportation and distribution). Companies may use either the site-specific method or the average-data method. For \nthe reasons outlined above, companies are more likely to apply the average-data method. Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [105] \nCATEGORY 9 Downstream Transportation and Distribution Example [9.1] Calculating emissions from downstream transportation\nCompany A sells timber to furniture Company B, which manufactures the timber into furniture, which it sells retail. \nCompany A collects information on the mass of timber sold to Company B and estimates the downstream transport \ndistances of the following:\n\u2022\tFrom point of sale to Company B (if not paid for by Company A)\n\u2022\tFrom Company B\u2019s manufacturing facility to retail distribution centers\n\u2022\tFrom retail distribution centers to retail outlets. \nThe data is summarized in the table below: \nPurchaser Mass of goods \nsold (tonnes)Total downstream dis-tance transported (km)Transport mode or vehicle typeEmission factor (kg CO\n2e/tonne-km)\nB 4 2,000 Truck  \n(rigid, >3.5-7.5t)0.2\nNote: the activity data and emissions factors are illustrative only, and do not refer to actual data. \nemissions from downstream transport:\n\u2211 (quantity of goods sold (tonnes) \u00d7 distance travelled in transport legs (km)\n\u00d7 emission factor of transport mode or vehicle type (kg CO2e/tonne-km))\n= 4 \u00d7 2,000 \u00d7 0.2 = 1,600 kg CO2eTechnical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [106] \n10\nCategory 10: \nProcessing of Sold Products\nCategory description\nCategory 10 includes emissions from processing of sold intermediate products \nby third parties (e.g., manufacturers) subsequent to sale by the reporting company. Intermediate products are products that require further processing, \ntransformation, or inclusion in another product before use (see box 5.3 of the Scope 3 \nStandard), and therefore result in emissions from processing subsequent to sale by the reporting company and before use by the end consumer. Emissions from processing should be allocated to the intermediate product.\nIn certain cases, the eventual end use of sold intermediate products may be unknown. For example, a company that \nproduces an intermediate product with many potential downstream applications, each of which has a different GHG \nemissions profile, may be unable to reasonably estimate the downstream emissions associated with these various \nend uses. See section 6.4 of the Scope 3 Standard for guidance in cases where downstream emissions associated \nwith sold intermediate products are unknown.\nSee section 5.6 of the Scope 3 Standard for guidance on the applicability of category 10 to final products and \nintermediate products sold by the reporting company. A reporting company\u2019s scope 3 emissions from processing  \nof sold intermediate products include the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of downstream value chain partners  \n(e.g., manufacturers).Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [107] \nCATEGORY 10 Processing of Sold ProductsCalculating emissions from processing of sold products\nFigure 10.1 gives a decision tree for selecting a calculation method for calculating scope 3 emissions from processing of \nsold products. Companies may use either of two methods:\n \u2022Site-specific method, which involves determining the amount of fuel and electricity used and the amount of waste generated from processing of sold intermediate products by the third party and applying the appropriate \nemission factors\n \u2022Average-data method, which involves estimating emissions for processing of sold intermediate products based on \naverage secondary data, such as average emissions per process or per product.\nCompanies should choose a calculation method based on their business goals and their ability to collect data from processing of sold intermediate products by third parties. In many cases, collecting primary data from downstream \nvalue chain partners may be difficult. In such cases, companies should use the average-data method. \nFigure [10.1] Decision tree for selecting a calculation method for emissions from processing of sold products\nSite-specific method\nTo calculate emissions from the processing of sold products by third parties, companies should collect either of the \nfollowing types of data from downstream value chain partners:\n \u2022Relevant activity data (e.g., fuel use, electricity use, refrigerant use, and waste) and relevant emission factors for each downstream process\n \u2022GHG emissions data for each downstream process calculated by downstream value chain partners.\nIf downstream processes involve intermediate goods and/or material inputs other than those sold by the reporting company, emissions should be allocated between intermediate product(s) sold by the reporting company and other \nintermediate products/material inputs. All processing steps through to the production of the final finished product should \nbe accounted for within this category. For examples of allocating emissions, refer to chapter 8 of the Scope 3 Standard.

A reporting company\u2019s scope 3 emissions from use of sold products include the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of end users. End users include \nboth\tconsumers \tand\tbusiness \tcustomers \tthat\tuse\tfinal\tproducts.\n \nThe Scope 3 Standard divides emissions from the use of sold products into two types (see also table 11.1):\n \u2022Direct use-phase emissions\n \u2022Indirect use-phase emissions.\nIn category 11, companies are required to include direct use-phase emissions of sold products. Companies may also account for indirect use-phase emissions of sold products, and should do so when indirect use-phase emissions are expected to be significant. See table 11.1 for descriptions and examples of direct and indirect use-phase emissions.\nCategory 11 includes the total expected lifetime emissions from all relevant products sold in the reporting year across \nthe company\u2019s product portfolio. (Refer to chapter 5.4 of the Scope 3 Standard for more information on the time \nboundary of scope 3 categories.) See box 11.1 in this chapter for an example of reporting product lifetime emissions and box 11.2 for guidance related to product lifetime and durability. The GHG Protocol Product Standard provides \ninformation on accounting for life cycle GHG emissions from individual products.\nCompanies may optionally include emissions associated with maintenance of sold products during use.\nSee section 5.6 of the Scope 3 Standard for guidance on the applicability of category 11 to final products and \nintermediate products sold by the reporting company.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [114] \nCATEGORY 11 Use of Sold Products Table [11.1]  Emissions from use of sold products\nType of Emissions Product Type Examples\nDirect use-phase  \nemissions (required)Products that directly consume energy (fuels or electricity) during use Automobiles, aircraft, engines, motors, power plants, buildings, appliances, electronics, lighting, \ndata centers, web-based software\nFuels and feedstocks Petroleum products, natural gas, coal, biofuels, and \ncrude oil\nGreenhouse gases and products that contain or form greenhouse gases that are emitted during use CO\n2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, refrigeration and \nair-conditioning equipment, industrial gases, fire \nextinguishers, fertilizers \nIndirect use-phase \nemissions (optional)Products that indirectly consume energy (fuels or electricity) during useApparel (requires washing and drying), food (re-quires cooking and refrigeration), pots and pans \n(require heating), and soaps and detergents (require \nheated water)\nSource: Table 5.8 from the Scope 3 Standard.\nCalculating emissions from category 11 typically requires product design specifications and assumptions about how \nconsumers use products (e.g., use profiles, assumed product lifetimes). Companies are required to report a description \nof the methodologies and assumptions used to calculate emissions (see chapter 11 of the Scope 3 Standard).\nWhere relevant, companies should report additional information on product performance when reporting scope \n3 emissions to provide additional transparency on steps companies are taking to reduce GHG emissions from sold \nproducts. Such information may include GHG intensity metrics, energy intensity metrics, and annual emissions from the \nuse of sold products (see section 11.3 of the Scope 3 Standard). See section 9.3 of the Scope 3 Standard for guidance on \nrecalculating base year emissions when methodologies or assumptions related to category 11 change over time.\nAny claims of avoided emissions related to a company\u2019s sold products must be reported separately from the company\u2019s \nscope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 inventories. (For more information, see section 9.5 of the Scope 3 Standard)\nBox [11.1] Example of reporting product lifetime emissions\nAn automaker sells 1 million cars in 2010. Each car has an expected lifetime of 10 years. The company reports the \nanticipated use-phase emissions of the 1 million cars it sold in 2010 over their 10-year expected lifetime. The company \nalso reports corporate average fuel economy (km per liter) and corporate average emissions (kg CO2e/km) as relevant \nemissions-intensity metrics.\nSource: Box 5.7 from the Scope 3 Standard.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [115] \nCATEGORY 11 Use of Sold Products Box [11.2] Product lifetime and durability\nBecause the scope 3 inventory accounts for total lifetime emissions of sold products, companies that produce more \ndurable products with longer lifetimes could appear to be penalized because, as product lifetimes increase, scope \n3 emissions increase, assuming all else is constant. To reduce the potential for emissions data to be misinterpreted, \ncompanies should also report relevant information such as product lifetimes and emissions intensity metrics to \ndemonstrate product performance over time. Relevant emissions intensity metrics may include annual emissions \nper product, energy efficiency per product, emissions per hour of use, emissions per kilometer driven, emissions per \nfunctional unit, etc.\nSource: Box 5.8 from the Scope 3 Standard.\nThis section provides guidance of the following:\n \u2022What should be included in the emissions from use of sold products\n \u2022Guidance on what to include in a use profile\n \u2022Reporting guidance\n \u2022Guidance on how to assess uncertainty on the product\u2019s use profile.\nCalculating emissions from use of sold products\nThis guidance provides calculation methods to calculate a company\u2019s:\n \u2022Direct use-phase emissions \n \u2022Indirect use-phase emissions.\nCalculation methods for direct use-phase emissions\nCompanies should first determine in which categories their products belong. The following products have direct-use \nphase emissions:\n \u2022Products that directly consume energy (fuels or electricity) during use: involves breaking down the use phase, measuring emissions per product, and aggregating emissions \n \u2022Fuels and feedstocks: involves collecting fuel use data and multiplying them by representative fuel emission factors \n \u2022Greenhouse gases and products that contain or form greenhouse gases that are emitted during use: involves \ncollecting data on the GHG contained in the product and multiplying them by the percent of GHGs released and GHG \nemission factors. \nIf a company sells a large selection of products, or if the use phase of multiple products is similar, it may choose to group similar products and use average statistics for a typical product in the product group. For example, a fast-moving \nconsumer goods company selling carbonated drinks may decide to group products by packaging types and treat all \nproducts within that group with the same use profile. Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [116] \nCATEGORY 11 Use of Sold ProductsCalculation method for direct use-phase emissions from products that directly consume energy  \n(fuels or electricity) during use\nIn this method, the company multiplies the lifetime number of uses of each product by the amount sold and an \nemission factor per use.

If its product is used globally, a company may consider using a global average electricity emission factor but estimating product use at a more granular level (either regional or \nnational) and applying regional or national electricity grid emission factors would result in more accurate emissions \nestimates for this category. Scenario uncertainty can also be helpful here.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [117] \nCATEGORY 11 Use of Sold Products Calculation formula [11.1]  Direct use-phase emissions from products that directly consume energy  \n(fuels or electricity) during use\nCO2e emissions from use of sold products =\nsum across fuels consumed from use of products:\n\u2211 (total lifetime expected uses of product \u00d7 number sold in reporting period\n\u00d7 fuel consumed per use (kWh) \u00d7 emission factor for fuel (kg CO2e/kWh))\n+\nsum across electricity consumed from use of products:\n\u2211 (total lifetime expected uses of product \u00d7 number sold in reporting period \n\u00d7 electricity consumed per use (kWh) \u00d7 emission factor for electricity (kg CO2e/kWh))\n+\nsum across refrigerant leakage from use of products:\n\u2211 (total lifetime expected uses of product \u00d7 number sold in reporting period \n\u00d7 refrigerant leakage per use (kg) \u00d7 global warming potential (kg CO2e/kg))\nExample [11.1]   Calculating direct use-phase emissions from products that directly c onsume energy  \n(fuels or electricity) during use\nCompany A is a manufacturer of electrical appliances such as washing machines and irons.

These may include biomass \nfor producing power, crops for producing biofuels, or crude oil for producing plastic products. If the reporting company \nis a producer of fuels and/or feedstocks, the use-phase emissions are calculated by multiplying the quantities of fuels/\nfeedstocks by the combustion emission factors for the fuels/feedstocks. If the feedstock is not combusted during the \nuse phase, no emissions should be calculated.  \nNote that only the combustion emissions should be reported in this category, not the upstream emissions associated with the feedstock/fuel. This method avoids double counting as the upstream emissions associated with the production of the \nfeedstock/fuel were already included in the reporting company\u2019s scope 1 and scope 2, as well as other scope 3 categories.\nActivity data needed\n \u2022Total quantities of fuels/feedstocks sold.\nEmission factors needed\n \u2022Combustion emission factors of fuel/feedstock.Example [11.1]   Calculating direct use-phase emissions from products that directly c onsume energy (fuels or \nelectricity) during use (continued)Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [119] \nCATEGORY 11 Use of Sold ProductsData collection guidance\nCombustion emission factors for fuel/feedstock are well documented by many internationally recognized sources such \nas the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report and those factors included in the GHG Protocol calculation tools. In practice, the \nemissions vary between applications and countries based on the following:\n \u2022Technology:  the completeness of combustion may vary from application to application\n \u2022Exact fuel mix:  the precise fuel mix may vary from region to region and company to company; for example, the \ntypes of aromatic hydrocarbon mixed with gasoline may alter the combustion emissions.\nBecause of this variation companies should use the most representative emission factors for their fuel. \nCalculation formula 11.2: Direct use-phase emissions from combusted fuels and feedstocks\nCO2e emissions from fuel =\nsum across fuels/feedstocks:\n\u2211 (total quantity of fuel/feedstock sold (e.g., kWh) \n\u00d7 combustion emission factor for fuel/feedstock (e.g., kg CO2e/kWh))\nCalculation method for direct use-phase emissions from greenhouse gases and products that contain or \nform greenhouse gases that are emitted during use\nSome products may contain GHGs which are emitted during use or at the end of the product\u2019s useful life (e.g. products \nthat contain refrigerents).\nIf the reporting company is a producer of products containing GHGs, use-phase emissions are calculated by multiplying \nthe quantities of products sold by the percentage of GHGs released per unit of GHG contained in the product and by \nthe global warming potential (GWP) of the greenhouse gases released. \nActivity data needed\n \u2022Total quantities of products sold\n \u2022Quantities of GHGs contained per product\n \u2022Percentage of GHGs released throughout the lifetime of the product. \nEmission factors needed\n \u2022GWP of the GHGs contained in the product, expressed in units of carbon dioxide per unit kilogram of the GHG (e.g., \n25 kg CO2e/kg)\nNote: If different GHGs are released by the product, the total carbon dioxide equivalent should be reported and the breakdown of GHGs (e.g., CO\n2, CH4, N2O) may be reported separately (see chapter 8 of the Scope 3 Standard). \nThe company should first account for all the different types of GHGs contained in a product, then aggregate for all products. If the use phase of a product is likely to be similar for multiple products, companies may group similar products.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [120] \nCATEGORY 11 Use of Sold ProductsCalculation formula [11.3]  Direct use-phase emissions from greenhouse gases and products that contain or \nform greenhouse gases that are emitted during use\nCO2e emissions from greenhouse gases and products that contain or form greenhouse gases  \nthat are emitted during use =\nsum across GHGs released in a product or product group:\n\u2211 (GHG contained per product \u00d7 Total Number of products sold \n\u00d7 % of GHG released during lifetime use of product \u00d7 GWP of the GHG)\nthen:\nsum across products or product groups:\n\u2211 (use phase emissions from product or product group 1,2,3\u2026)\nNote: if the % released is unknown 100% should be assumed.\nCalculation methods for indirect use-phase emissions\nCalculation method for indirect use-phase emissions from products that indirectly consume energy (fuels or electricity) during use\nFor products that indirectly consume energy or emit GHGs (see table 11.1), the reporting company should calculate \nemissions by creating or obtaining a typical use-phase profile over the lifetime of the product and multiplying by \nrelevant emission factors. \nActivity data needed\n \u2022Average number of uses over lifetime of product\n \u2022Average use scenarios (e.g., weighted average of scenarios)\n \u2022Fuel consumed in use scenarios\n \u2022Electricity consumed in use scenarios\n \u2022Refrigerant leakage in use scenarios\n \u2022GHGs emitted indirectly in use scenarios.\nEmission factors needed\n \u2022Combustion emission factors of fuels and electricity.\nIdeally agreement should be reached by a sector (e.g., industry associations and trade bodies) on common rules for use-\nphase assumptions.

Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [121] \nCATEGORY 11 Use of Sold ProductsData collection guidance\nThe generation of a typical use phase may be difficult because the same product may consume more or less energy \ndepending on the conditions in which it is used. For example, a potato may be roasted, boiled, or microwaved, each \ncooking method using a different amount of energy and thus producing different levels of emissions. \nTherefore, it is important to generate a use profile that is representative of use scenarios over the lifetime of the \nproduct by the intended consumer population. These may come from sources such as:\n \u2022Industry recognized benchmark testing specifications\n \u2022Product category rules\n \u2022Previous emissions studies\n \u2022Consumer studies.\nCompanies may choose to identify several different use-phase scenarios for a product and create a weighted average \nbased upon actual activity.\nCalculation formula [11.4]  Indirect use-phase emissions from products that indirectly consume energy \n(fuels or electricity) during use\nIndirect use-phase CO2e emissions of products =\nsum across fuels consumed from use scenarios:\n\u2211 (total lifetime expected uses of product \u00d7 % of total lifetime uses using this scenario\n\u00d7 number sold in reporting period \u00d7 fuel consumed per use in this scenario (e.g., kWh)\n\u00d7 emission factor for fuel (e.g., kg CO2e/kWh))\n+\nsum across electricity consumed from use scenarios:\n\u2211 (total lifetime expected uses of product \u00d7 % of total lifetime uses using this scenario\n\u00d7 number sold in reporting period \u00d7 electricity consumed per use in this scenario (kWh)\n\u00d7 emission factor for electricity (kg CO2e/kWh))\n+\nsum across refrigerant leakage from use scenarios:\n\u2211 (total lifetime expected uses of product \u00d7 % of total lifetime uses using this scenario\n\u00d7 number sold in reporting period \u00d7 refrigerant leakage per use in this scenario (kg)\n\u00d7 emission factor for refrigerant (kg CO2e/kg))\n+\nsum across GHG emitted indirectly from use scenarios:\n\u2211 (total lifetime expected uses of product \u00d7 % of total lifetime uses using this scenario\n\u00d7 number sold in reporting period \u00d7 GHG emitted indirectly (kg) \u00d7 GWP of the GHG)Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [122] \nCATEGORY 11 Use of Sold Products Example [11.2]  Calculating indirect use-phase emissions from products that indirectly consume energy \n(fuels or electricity) during use\nCompany A produces laundry soap, which indirectly entails consumption of electricity during the use phase.

The allocation is based on the weight of the engine as a proportion \nof the total weight of the airplane. For allocation rules refer to section 8 of the Scope 3 Standard.20  Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [125] \n12\nCategory 12:  \nEnd-of-Life Treatment  \nof Sold Products\nCategory description\nCategory 12 includes emissions from the waste disposal and treatment of products \nsold by the reporting company (in the reporting year) at the end of their life. This category includes the total expected end-of-life emissions from all products sold in \nthe reporting year. (See section 5.4 of the Scope 3 Standard for more information on the time \nboundary of scope 3 categories.) \nEnd-of-life treatment methods (e.g., landfilling, incineration, and recycling) are described in category 5 (Waste \ngenerated in operations) and apply to both category 5 and category 12. Calculating emissions from category 12 \nrequires assumptions about the end-of-life treatment methods used by consumers. Companies are required to report a \ndescription of the methodologies and assumptions used to calculate emissions (see chapter 11 of the Scope 3 Standard).\nFor sold intermediate products, companies should account for the emissions from disposing of the intermediate \nproduct at the end of its life, not the final product.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [126] \nCATEGORY 12 End-of-Life Treatment of Sold ProductsCalculating emissions from end-of-life treatment of sold products\nThe emissions from downstream end-of-life treatment of sold products should follow the calculation methods in \ncategory 5 (Waste generated in operations), with the difference that instead of collecting data on total mass of waste \ngenerated in operations, companies should collect data on total mass of sold products (and packaging) from the point \nof sale by the reporting company through the end of life after use by consumers. \nThe major difference between calculating upstream and downstream emissions of waste treatment is likely to be the \navailability and quality of waste activity data. Whereas the reporting company is likely have specific waste type and \nwaste treatment data from its own operations, this information is likely to be more difficult to obtain for sold products. \nAlthough the reporting company may know the product\u2019s components, it may not know how the waste-disposal \nbehavior of consumers and retailers varies across geographic regions. \nIf the reporting company sells intermediate products, it is required to account for emissions from disposing of the sold \nintermediate products at the end of their life.\nActivity data needed\nCompanies should collect:\n \u2022Total mass of sold products and packaging from the point of sale by the reporting company to the end-of-life after consumer use (e.g., packaging used to transport products through to the point of retail and any packaging that is \ndisposed of prior to the end-of-life of the final product\n \u2022Proportion of this waste being treated by different methods (e.g., percent landfilled, incinerated, recycled).\nEmission factors neededCompanies should collect:\n \u2022Average waste-treatment specific-emission factors based on all waste treatment types.\nData collection guidance\nWhen collecting data on total waste produced, the reporting company should collect data on the waste type(s) and \namounts after it sells the products through to the end-of-life disposal by consumers. This data should include any \npackaging and product waste. For food and drink items, companies should refer to average proportion of food/drinks \nwasted. In many cases, total waste will be equal to the total products sold in reporting year. However, if the product is actually consumed (e.g., food and drink) the total waste is likely to be lower, and in other cases, such as products \ncombusted to generate energy, could even be zero.\nWhen collecting data on the proportion of waste treated by different methods, companies may refer to:\n \u2022Company\u2019s own research and internal data on how its products are treated after consumption\n \u2022Specific government directives on waste treatment of certain products (e.g., the European Union\u2019s \u201cWaste Electrical \nand Electronic Equipment Directive\u201d)\n \u2022Industry associations or organizations that have conducted research into consumer disposal patterns of specific products\n \u2022Average data on waste treatment from the point that the products are sold by the reporting company through to the end of life after consumer use.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [127] \nCATEGORY 12 End-of-Life Treatment of Sold Products Calculation resources include:\n \u2022The European Union publishes data on average end-of-life treatment scenarios of different product groups in EU \nmember countries (see http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/waste/introduction/)\n \u2022The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also publishes data on waste generation, recycling, and disposal statistics, available at: http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/msw99.htm  \n \u2022Waste Resources and Action Programme (WRAP) publishes average food and drinks waste as a proportion of purchased amount in the UK economy, which may be used in the absence of product-specific data (see http://www.\nwrap.org.uk/retail_supply_chain/research_tools/research/report_household.html).\nCalculation formula [12.1] Waste-type-specific method\nCO2e emissions from end-of-life treatment of sold products =\nsum across waste treatment methods:\n\u2211 (total mass of sold products and packaging from point of sale to end of life after consumer use (kg)\n\u00d7 % of total waste being treated by waste treatment method\n\u00d7 emission factor of waste treatment method (kg CO2e/kg))\nExample [12.1] Calculating emissions from the end-of-life treatment of sold products\nCompany A sells paper that is laminated in a way that does not allow recycling. In the reporting period, Company A sold \n10,000 tonnes of product. The company conducts consumer research to understand the disposal methods used by \nend consumers.

This category is applicable to \nlessors (i.e., companies that receive payments from lessees). Companies that operate leased assets (i.e., lessees) should refer to category 8 (Upstream leased assets).\nLeased assets may be included in a company\u2019s scope 1 or scope 2 inventory depending on the type of lease and the \nconsolidation approach the company uses to define its organizational boundaries. (See section 5.2 of the Scope 3 \nStandard for more information.) If the reporting company leases an asset for only part of the reporting year, the reporting company should account for emissions from the portion of the year that the asset was leased. See Appendix \nA of the Scope 3 Standard for more information on accounting for emissions from leased assets.\nIn some cases, companies may not find value in distinguishing between products sold to customers (accounted for in \ncategory 11) and products leased to customers (accounted for in category 13). A company may account for products \nleased to customers in the same way it accounts for products sold to customers (i.e., by accounting for the total \nexpected lifetime emissions from all relevant products leased to other entities in the reporting year). Companies should \nreport emissions from leased products in category 11 (Use of sold products), rather than category 13 (Downstream leased assets) and avoid double counting between categories.\nA reporting company\u2019s scope 3 emissions from downstream leased assets include the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of \nlessees (depending on the lessee\u2019s consolidation approach).Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [129] \nCATEGORY 13 Downstream Leased Assets Calculating emissions from leased assets\nDownstream leased assets differ from upstream leased assets in that the leased assets are owned by the reporting \ncompany. The availability and access to information depends on the type of asset leased. For example, a company that \nleases vehicles may need to request fuel or mileage data from lessees in order to calculate emissions. \nThe calculation methods for upstream and downstream leased assets do not differ. For guidance on calculating \nemissions from category 13 (Downstream leased assets), refer to the guidance for category 8 (Upstream leased assets).\nCompanies requesting scope 1 and scope 2 data from lessees using the asset-specific method in category 8 (Upstream \nleased assets) may need to request additional information from the lessee in order to properly allocate emissions to the reporting company\u2019s leased assets. The lessee\u2019s scope 1 and scope 2 emissions data maybe aggregated, as with \nbuildings without sub-metering. The reporting company may need to allocate these emissions in order to calculate \nemissions from this category. For guidance on collecting data and allocating emissions, refer to chapter 7 and chapter 8 \nof the Scope 3 Standard.\nExample [13.1] Calculating the emissions from downstream leased assets\nCompany C (lessor) leases out a factory (factory 1) to Company D. Company D (lessee) knows its aggregated corporate \nscope 1 and scope 2 emissions of both factory 1 and a separate unit it operates, Factory 2. For company C to determine \nemissions associated with factory 1, it must allocate total emissions from both factories. It chooses to allocate based on \nphysical allocation (i.e., floor space). The floor space of factory 1 is 5,000 m2 and factory 2 is 10,000 m2. \nThe data is summarized in the table below:  \nCombined scope 1 and scope 2 emissions  \n(kg CO2e)Floor space (m2)\nFactory 1\n9,000 5,000 \nFactory 2 10,000 \nNote: The activity data and emissions factors are illustrative only, and do not refer to actual data\nThe emissions of company C\u2019s (lessor) downstream leased asset is calculated as follows:\n\u2211 scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of lessee (kg CO2e) \n\u00d7    physical area of the leased asset (e.g., area, volume)\n      total physical area of lessor assets (e.g., area, volume)\n= 9,000 \u00d7 (5,000 / 15,000) = 3,000 kg CO2eTechnical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [130] \n14\nCategory 14:  \nFranchises\nCategory description\nCategory 14 includes emissions from the operation of franchises not included in scope \n1 or scope 2. A franchise is a business operating under a license to sell or distribute another company\u2019s goods or services within a certain location. This category is \napplicable to franchisors (i.e., companies that grant licenses to other entities to sell or distribute its goods or services in return for payments, such as royalties for the use of trademarks and other services). Franchisors should account for emissions that occur from the operation of franchises (i.e., the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of franchisees) in this category.\nFranchisees (i.e., companies that operate franchises and pay fees to a franchisor) should include emissions from \noperations under their control in this category if they have not included those emissions in scope 1 and scope 2 due to \ntheir choice of consolidation approach. Franchisees may optionally report upstream scope 3 emissions associated with \nthe franchisor\u2019s operations (i.e., the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of the franchisor) in category 1 (Purchased goods \nand services).\nCalculating emissions from franchises\nCompanies may use either of two methods to calculate emissions from franchises:\n \u2022Franchise-specific method, which involves collecting site-specific activity data or scope 1 and scope 2 emissions \ndata from franchisees \n \u2022Average-data method, which involves estimating emissions for each franchise, or groups of franchises, based on average statistics, such as average emissions per franchise type or floor space.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [131] \nCATEGORY 14 FranchisesFranchise-specific method \nThe franchise-specific method involves collecting scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from franchisees. If franchisees have \nconducted corporate scope 1 and scope 2 GHG inventory report(s), the data can be applied immediately. If such reports \nare not available, site-specific fuel and energy data from individual franchises should be collected. The reporting \ncompany should determine whether the franchisee delivers business solely for the reporting company (i.e., franchisor), \nand if not, the franchisee or the reporting company should allocate the emissions accordingly. Guidance on allocation is \nprovided in chapter 8 of the Scope 3 Standard.\nIf significant upstream emissions result from the purchase of goods and services by franchisees, the franchisor \ndeveloping the scope 3 inventory should include these emissions in this category. For example, a large fast-food \nfranchise should account for the upstream emissions associated with the beef purchased by its franchise restaurants.\nActivity data needed\nCompanies should collect data on either:\n \u2022Scope 1, scope 2, and (optionally) scope 3 emissions data from franchisees \n \u2022Site-specific fuel use, electricity use, and process and fugitive emissions activity data if applicable.\nEmission factors neededIf collecting fuel and energy data, companies should also collect:\n \u2022Site- or regionally-specific emission factors for energy sources (e.g., electricity and fuels) per unit of consumption (e.g., kg CO\n2e/kWh for electricity, kg CO2e/liter for diesel)\n \u2022Emission factors of process emissions and fugitive emissions (e.g., refrigeration and air conditioning)\n \u2022Upstream emission factors. \nData collection guidance\n \u2022Data sources for activity data include:\n \u2022Public GHG inventory reports accessible through GHG reporting programs\n \u2022Utility bills\n \u2022Purchase records\n \u2022Meter readings \n \u2022Internal IT systems. \nData sources for emission factors include:\n \u2022The GHG Protocol websites (http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools and http://www.ghgprotocol.org/standards/scope-3-standard)\n \u2022Company-specific emission factors\n \u2022Industry associations\n \u2022Government agencies (e.g., Defra provides emission factors for the United Kingdom)\n \u2022For activity data, emission factors, and formulas for process and fugitive emissions, see the GHG Protocol website (http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools ) and the IPCC 2006 Guidelines (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.\nor.jp/public/2006gl/index.html).Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [132] \nCATEGORY 14 FranchisesCalculation formula [14.1] Franchise-specific method \nCO2e emissions from franchises =\nsum across franchises:\n\u2211 (scope 1 emissions + scope 2 emissions of each franchise (kg CO2e))\nTo calculate scope 3 emissions from franchises, aggregate the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of all franchises, using the \nformula above.\nFranchises that operate in a portion of a building where energy use is not separately sub-metered may estimate \nenergy consumed using the franchise\u2019s share of the building\u2019s total floor space and total building energy use, \nfollowing this formula:\nCalculation formula [14.2] Allocating emissions from franchise buildings that are not sub-metered \nCO2e emissions allocated to franchise =\nenergy use from franchise (kWh)\n= \n building\u2019s total area (m2) \u00d7 building\u2019s occupancy rate (e.g., 0.75)  \u00d7  building\u2019s total energy use (kWh)\nUsing Samples\nIf a company has a large number of individual franchises, it may not be practical to collect data from each franchise. \nTherefore, companies may use appropriate sampling techniques when collecting data to represent all franchises from a \nrepresentative sample of franchises. See Appendix A for more information on sampling.\nCompanies may also choose to categorize franchises into similar groups for data collection. The grouping strategy \nshould group franchises with similar anticipated emissions intensities. Below is a non-exclusive list of possible ways to \ngroup franchises:\n \u2022Location, (e.g., country \u2013 particularly if electricity emission factors differ significantly among countries)\n \u2022Building type (e.g., free-standing buildings; leased shop space in shopping centres; shop-front at base of a larger city building)\n \u2022Floor space\n \u2022Financial turnover\n \u2022Product volume\n \u2022Customer numbers\n \u2022Distinctive characteristics (e.g., gyms with saunas, hotels with pools).franchise\u2019s area (m2) Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [133] \nCATEGORY 14 Franchises Calculation formula [14.3] Extrapolating emissions from sample groups\nCO2e emissions from franchises = \nStep 1: aggregation of franchise emissions per group:\n \ntotal emissions from sampled franchises within group \n\u00d7        total number of franchises within group\n         number of franchises sampled within group\nStep 2: aggregation of total franchise emissions across all groups:\n \u2211 total scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from each asset group\nCompanies that extrapolate from a representative sample within a franchise group should use the formula 14.2 \nto calculate emissions from sampled franchises within a group, then apply the formula in Step 1 above to estimate emissions for a franchise group.

For example, companies that use the equity-share approach include emissions from equity \ninvestments in scope 1 and scope 2. Companies that use a control approach account only for those equity investments \nthat are under the company\u2019s control in scope 1 and scope 2. Investments not included in the company\u2019s scope 1 or \nscope 2 emissions are included in scope 3, in this category.

Table 15.1 provides the \ntypes of investments required to be accounted for in this category. Table 15.2 identifies types of investments that companies may optionally report.\nEmissions from investments should be allocated to the reporting company based on the reporting company\u2019s \nproportional share of investment in the investee. Because investment portfolios are dynamic and can change frequently \nthroughout the reporting year, companies should identify investments by choosing a fixed point in time, such as December 31 of the reporting year, or by using a representative average over the course of the reporting year.\nTable [15.1] Accounting for emissions from investments (required)\nFinancial \ninvestment/ \nserviceDescription GHG accounting approach  \n(required)\nEquity investments Equity investments made by the reporting \ncompany using the company\u2019s own capital and \nbalance sheet, including:\n\u2022  Equity investments in subsidiaries (or group \ncompanies) where the reporting company has \nfinancial control (typically more than 50 percent \nownership)\n\u2022  Equity investments in associate companies (or affiliated companies), where the reporting com-\npany has significant influence but not financial \ncontrol (typically 20-50 percent ownership)\n\u2022  Equity investments in joint ventures (non-incor -\nporated joint ventures/partnerships/ operations), \nwhere partners have joint financial controlIn general, companies in the financial services sector should account for emis-\nsions from equity investments in scope 1 and scope 2 by using the equity share \nconsolidation approach to obtain represen-\ntative scope 1 and scope 2 inventories. If emissions from equity investments are not \nincluded in scope 1 or scope 2 (because the \nreporting company uses either the opera-tional control or financial control consoli-\ndation approach and does not have control \nover the investee), account for proportional scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of equity in-vestments* that occur in the reporting year in scope 3, category 15 (Investments).\nEquity investments made by the reporting company using the company\u2019s own capital and \nbalance sheet, where the reporting company \nhas neither financial control nor significant influence over the emitting entity (and typically \nhas less than 20 percent ownership).If not included in the reporting company\u2019s \nscope 1 and scope 2 inventories: Account \nfor proportional scope 1 and scope 2 emissions \nof equity investments* that occur in the re -\nporting year in scope 3, category 15 (Invest -\nments).

Therefore equity investments made by insurance companies using insurance premiums are required to be reported (although companies may establish a threshold for equity investments). Accounting for emissions from insurance contracts is not required.\n*Additional guidance on key concepts italicized is provided below.\n \n\u2022   Proportional emissions from equity investments should be allocated to the investor based on the investor\u2019s proportional share of \nequity in the investee. Proportional emissions from project finance and debt investments with known use of proceeds should be allocated to the investor based on the investor\u2019s proportional share of total project costs (total equity plus debt). Companies may separately report additional metrics, such as total emissions of the investee, the investor\u2019s proportional share of capital investment in the investee, etc.\n \n\u2022   Scope 1 and scope 2 emissions include the direct (scope 1) emissions of the investee or project, as well as the indirect (scope 2) emissions from the generation of electricity consumed by the investee or project. If relevant, companies should also account for the scope 3 emissions of the investee or project. For example, if a financial institution provides equity or debt financing to a light bulb manufacturer, the financial institution is required to account for the proportional scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of the light bulb manufacturer (i.e., direct emissions during manufacturing and indirect emissions from electricity consumed during manufacturing). The financial institution should account for the scope 3 emissions of the light bulb producer (e.g., scope 3 emissions from consumer use of light bulbs sold by the manufacturer) when scope 3 emissions are significant compared to other source of emissions or otherwise relevant\n \u2022  \n Relevant projects  include those in GHG-intensive sectors (e.g., power generation), projects exceeding a specified emissions threshold \n(defined by the company or industry sector), or projects that meet other criteria developed by the company or industry sector. Companies should account for emissions from the GHG-emitting project financed by the reporting company, regardless of any financial intermediaries involved in the transaction.\n \n\u2022   Total projected lifetime emissions are reported in the initial year the project is financed, not in subsequent years. If a project\u2019s anticipated lifetime is uncertain, companies may report a range of likely values (e.g., for a coal-fired power plant, a company may report a range over a 30- to 60-year time period). Companies should report the assumptions used to estimate total anticipated lifetime emissions. If project financing occurs only once every few years, emissions from project finance may fluctuate significantly from year to year. Companies should provide appropriate context in the public report (e.g., by highlighting exceptional or non-recurring project financing). See section 5.4 of the Scope 3 Standard for more information on the time boundary of scope 3 categories.Table [15.1] Accounting for emissions from investments (required) (continued)Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [139] \nCATEGORY 15 InvestmentsTable [15.2] Accounting for emissions from investments (optional)\nFinancial \ninvestment/ serviceDescription GHG accounting approach (optional)\nDebt investments\n(without known \nuse of proceeds)General corporate purposes debt holdings (such as bonds or \nloans) held in the reporting company\u2019s portfolio where the \nuse of proceeds is not specifiedCompanies may account for scope 1 \nand scope 2 emissions of the invest -\nee that occur in the reporting year in scope 3, category 15 (Investments)\nManaged  investments and \nclient servicesInvestments managed by the reporting company on behalf \nof clients (using clients\u2019 capital\na) or services provided by the \nreporting company to clients, including:\n\u2022 Investment and asset management (equity or fixed income \nfunds managed on behalf of clients, using clients\u2019 capital)\n\u2022 Corporate underwriting and issuance for clients seeking \nequity or debt capital\n\u2022 Financial advisory services for clients seeking assistance \nwith mergers and acquisitions or requesting other advisory \nservicesCompanies may account for  \nemissions from managed invest -\nments and client services in scope 3, \ncategory 15 (Investments)\nOther  investments or \nfinancial servicesAll other types of investments, financial contracts, or \nfinancial services not included above (e.g., pension funds, \nretirement accounts, securitized products, insurance con-tracts, credit guarantees, financial guarantees, export credit \ninsurance, credit default swaps, etc.)Companies may account for  emissions from other investments in \nscope 3, category 15 (Investments)\nSource: Table 5.10 from the Scope 3 Standard\nNotes:\na.

See table15.2. GHG Protocol may develop further guidance for calculating category 15 emissions. \nCheck the GHG Protocol website for the latest guidance for accounting for GHG emissions associated with lending and \ninvestments: http://www.ghgprotocol.org/feature/financial-sector-guidance-corporate-value-chain-scope-3-accounting-\nand-reporting.\nBecause financial services companies may have a large number of investments, investments should be screened to \nprioritize investments that are likely to contribute most significantly to total GHG emissions. It is recommended that a \nscreening, using the average-data methods described below, be carried out as a first step to calculating emissions from \ninvestments. This screening should enable financial institutions to identify their investments with the highest emissions and focus on these for primary data collection.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [140] \nCATEGORY 15 InvestmentsCalculating emissions from equity investments\nIt is a requirement of the Scope 3 Standard to report emissions from equity investments made by the reporting company \nusing the company\u2019s own capital and balance sheet, including:  \n \u2022Equity investments in subsidiaries (or group companies), where the reporting company has financial control (typically more than 50 percent ownership)\n \u2022 Equity investments in associate companies (or affiliated companies), where the reporting company has significant influence but not financial control (typically 20-50 percent ownership)\n \u2022Equity investments in joint ventures (non-incorporated joint ventures/partnerships/ operations), where partners have joint financial control\n \u2022Equity investments where the reporting company has neither financial control nor significant influence over the emitting entity (and typically has less than 20 percent ownership). For these equity investments, companies may \nestablish a threshold (e.g., equity share of 1 percent) below which the company excludes equity investments from \nthe inventory, if disclosed and justified.\nCompanies should account for the proportional scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of the investments that occur in the reporting year. Proportional emissions from equity investments should be allocated to the investor based on the \ninvestor\u2019s proportional share of equity in the investee. Figure 15.1 shows a decision tree for selecting a calculation \nmethod for emissions from equity investments. Companies may use the following methods:\n \u2022Investment-specific method, which involves collecting scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from the investee company and allocating the emissions based upon the share of investment; or\n \u2022Average-data method, which involves using revenue data combined with EEIO data to estimate the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from the investee company and allocating emissions based upon share of investment.\nCompanies should account for the proportional scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of the investments that occur in the reporting year. Companies should account for emissions from the GHG-emitting business activity, regardless of any \nfinancial intermediaries involved in the transaction. When scope 3 emissions are significant compared to other sources \nof emissions, investors should also account for the scope 3 emissions of the investee company. Calculating GHG \nemissions throughout the value chain of investee companies can help the investor understand and manage the climate \nchange-related risks associated with his or her investments. If the majority of an investee company\u2019s emissions are \nassociated with its value chain, then only focusing on scope 1 and scope 2 emissions will not provide the full picture of \nthe company\u2019s risks. If the investor wants to understand the full GHG impact of the investee companies across their full value chain, for example, to identify hotspots for further engagement, including scope 3 may be more appropriate.\nThe GHG Protocol does not set a threshold above which scope 3 emissions should be included; instead, reporting \ncompanies should develop their own significance threshold based on their business goals. EEIO data can be used to \nquickly estimate the relative size of scope 3 emissions compared to scope 1 and scope 2 emissions for any sector.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [141] \nCATEGORY 15 Investments Box [15.1] Applicability of calculation methods to managed investments (e.g. mutual funds)\nWhether an organization is required to report on equity investments depends on whose capital is being invested. Asset \nowners are investing their own capital, so they are required to report emissions from equity investments (although they \nmay establish a threshold, as described in table 15.1). \nAsset managers investing clients\u2019 capital may optionally report on emissions from equity investments managed on behalf \nof clients (e.g., mutual funds). Emissions from these types of equity investments can be calculated using the methods described in this section, however it should be noted that mutual funds and other funds managed on behalf of clients \nare not the primary audience for the calculation methods described here and some of their specific issues have not been \naddressed, including the business goals relevant to a fund manager and the appropriate use of inventory results.\nFigure [15.1] Decision tree for selecting a calculation method for emissions from equity investments\nInvestment-specific method\nThe investment-specific method involves collecting scope 1 and scope 2 emissions directly from investee companies \nand allocating these emissions based upon the proportion of the investment. \nActivity data needed\nCompanies should collect:\n \u2022Scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of investee company\n \u2022The investor\u2019s proportional share of equity in the investee\n \u2022If significant, companies should also collect scope 3 emissions of the investee company (if investee companies are unable to provide scope 3 emissions data, scope 3 emissions may need to be estimated using the average-data \nmethod described in option 2).Use average-data \nmethodUse investment-  \nspecific approach\nno noCan the investee \ncompany provide scope 1 \nand scope 2 data?yes yesDoes the equity investment \ncontribute significantly \nto scope 3 emissions \n(based on screening) \nor is engagement  with \nthe investee company \notherwise relevant to the \nbusiness goals?

The revenue of the investee company should be multiplied by the \nappropriate EEIO emission factor that is representative of the investee company\u2019s sector of the economy. For example, an \napparel manufacturer should use an EEIO emission factor for apparel manufacturing. The reporting company should then \nuse its proportional share of equity to allocate the estimated scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of the investee company. \nUsing EEIO data has limitations. EEIO databases contain average emission factors for each sector; therefore, when \nEEIO data is used to estimate emissions from investments, it is not possible to differentiate between investments \nwithin a particular sector. Using EEIO data can enable an investor to identify which sectors contribute most to its scope \n3 investments category emissions, but investee-specific data would be required to identify the emissions hotspots \nwithin a particular sector. Another limitation is that the use of EEIO data will not enable the investor to track the GHG emissions of investee companies over time. See \u201cEnvironmentally-extended input output (EEIO) data,\u201d in the \nIntroduction for a broader discussion of the limitations of EEIO data.\nActivity data needed\nThe reporting company should collect;\n \u2022Sector(s) the investee company operates in \n \u2022Revenue of investee company (if the investee company operates in more than one sector, the reporting company \nshould collect data on the revenue for each sector in which it operates)\n \u2022The investor\u2019s proportional share of equity in the investee.\nEmission factors needed\nThe reporting company should collect:\n \u2022EEIO emission factors for the sectors of the economy that the investments are related to (kg CO2e/$ revenue).\nThe minimum boundary for reporting is the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of the investee company. However, EEIO \ndatabases provide emission factors that include all upstream emissions. Therefore, if the investor is reporting only scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of the investee company, the EEIO emissions factor will need to be disaggregated to \nseparate scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from all other upstream scope 3 emissions. Disaggregating the EEIO emission \nfactor enables reporting companies to separate the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from all other upstream scope 3 \nemissions, although sufficient information to do this may not be available. If disaggregation of the EEIO emission is not \npossible, reporting companies should use the full EEIO emission factor (i.e. include all upstream emissions). Reporting \ncompanies should clearly disclose the boundary used (either scope 1 and scope 2, or all upstream emissions).Example [15.1]  Calculating emissions from equity investments using the investment-specific method \n(continued) Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [144] \nCATEGORY 15 InvestmentsWhen scope 3 emissions are significant compared with other sources of emissions, investors should also account for the \nscope 3 emissions of the investee company.

Corporate debt holdings with known use of proceeds are defined in the Scope 3 Standard as debt investments where the use of \nproceeds is identified as going to a particular project, such as to build a specific power plant. \nFor each year during the term of the investment, companies should account for proportional scope 1 and scope 2 \nemissions of relevant projects that occur in the reporting year. Proportional emissions from project finance and debt investments with known use of proceeds should be allocated to the investor based on the investor\u2019s proportional share \nof total project costs (total equity plus debt).\nIf scope 3 emissions of projects are significant compared to scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, investors should also \naccount for proportional scope 3 emissions of projects that occur in the reporting year. This accounting could be \nparticularly relevant for infrastructure projects like highways or bridges, where the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions \nduring the operational phase of the projects are minimal compared with the scope 3 emissions from the use of the \ninfrastructure (i.e., the emissions from the vehicles driving on the highway or bridge).\nFigure 15.2 shows a decision tree for selecting a calculation method for emissions from project finance and debt \ninvestments with known use of proceeds. Companies may use the following methods: \n \u2022Project-specific method, which involves collecting scope 1 and scope 2 emissions for the relevant project(s) and allocating these emissions based on the investor\u2019s proportional share of total project costs (total equity plus debt)\n \u2022Average-data method, which involves using EEIO data to estimate the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from the investee company and allocating emissions based on share of total project costs (total equity plus debt).\nIf the reporting company is an initial sponsor or lender of a project, it should also account for the total projected lifetime scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of relevant projects financed during the reporting year, and report those \nemissions separately from scope 3. The methods for calculating total projected lifetime emissions of projects are \ndescribed in a subsequent section of this chapter - Calculating total projected lifetime emissions from project finance and \ndebt investments with known use of proceeds.\nBox [15.2] Calculating emissions from general corporate purposes debt investments\nThe Scope 3 Standard distinguishes debt investments with known use of proceeds from general corporate purposes debt \nholdings (see tables 15.1 and 15.2). General corporate purposes debt holdings (such as bonds or loans) where the use \nof proceeds is not specified can optionally be reported in a reporting company\u2019s scope 3 inventory. \n Calculating emissions from debt investments where the use of proceeds is not specified should use the methods \ndescribed for equity investments in section 15.1 (Calculating emissions from equity investments) except that the proportional share should be calculated based on the investor\u2019s proportional share of total equity plus debt. It should \nbe noted that the calculation methodologies described in this guidance apply to long-term debt.

For example, for a manufacturing facility construction \nproject, an EEIO emission factor for \u201cConstruction of nonresidential manufacturing structures\u201d should be used.

If possible, the EEIO data should be representative of the e geographic region where \nthe project is located.\nIf a project (e.g., certain infrastructure projects) does not generate revenue during its operational phase then EEIO \ndata cannot be used to estimate emissions. In these cases, other data or assumptions, such as industry or government studies of similar projects, can be used to estimate emissions from the operational phase. \nData collection guidance\nData may be collected from the following sources:\n \u2022Project cost and investment share data will be available from financial records of the reporting company and the investee company\n \u2022Emission factors from EEIO databases (a list of databases is provided on the GHG Protocol website http://www.\nghgprotocol.org/Third-Party-Databases ). Additional databases may be added periodically, so continue to check the website.

It makes debt investments in a number of companies for specific projects (such as \nbuilding a new power plant).

Company A states that it will consider engagement with investee companies in future years.\nCompany A collects data from its internal data management system.

Accounting for the projected lifetime emissions reflects the longer term nature of these forms \nof investment. Accounting for total projected lifetime emissions is in addition to (and separate from) accounting for \nannual scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of projects for each year during the term of the investment (as described in the \nprevious section Calculating emissions from project finance and from debt investments with known use of proceeds).\nTotal projected lifetime emissions are reported in the initial year the project is financed, not in subsequent years, and \nemissions should not be amortized or discounted. As it is required for companies to account for proportional scope 1 and \nscope 2 emissions of projects for each year during the term of the investment, reporting amortized projected lifetime \nemissions each year during the term of the investment in addition to annual scope 1 and scope 2 emissions would result in double counting. Once the project has been constructed and is operational, the lifetime emissions have been locked \nin, so it is in the initial stage of a project where total lifetime emissions should be taken into consideration. Companies \nshould report the assumptions used to estimate total anticipated lifetime scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. \nWhen scope 3 emissions of projects are significant compared to scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, investors should also \naccount for total projected lifetime scope 3 emissions of projects. This could be particularly relevant for infrastructure \nprojects like highways or bridges, where the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of the projects during the operational phase \nare minimal compared to the scope 3 emissions from the use of the infrastructure (i.e., the emissions from the vehicles \ndriving on the highway or bridge).\nAny claims of avoided emissions related to a project must be reported separately from the company\u2019s scope 1, scope 2, \nand scope 3 inventories. (For more information, see section 9.5 of the Scope 3 Standard).\nCalculating projected lifetime emissions typically requires making assumptions about the operation of the asset and its \nexpected lifetime. The data needed to calculate expected emissions will depend on the type of project.\nCompanies should collect:\n \u2022Expected average annual emissions of project. For power plants for example, emissions can be derived from the \nplant\u2019s capacity and heat rate, the carbon content of the fuel, and projected capacity utilization\n \u2022Expected lifetime of project.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [152] \nCATEGORY 15 Investments \n If there is uncertainty around a project\u2019s anticipated lifetime, companies may report a range of likely values (e.g., for a \ncoal-fired power plant, a company may report a range of 30- to 60-years).\nCalculation formula [15.4]   Method f or calculating projected total lifetime emissions from project finance \nand debt investments with known use of proceeds\nProjected total lifetime emissions from project finance and debt investments  \nwith known use proceeds =\n\u2211 ((projected annual emissions of project x projected lifetime of project) x share of total project costs)\nNote that project total lifetime emissions are only required to be reported in the initial year the project is financed, so the share of total \nproject costs (total equity plus debt) refers only to initial sponsors/lenders.\nExample [15.5]   Calculating project ed total lifetime emissions from project finance and debt investments \nwith known use of proceeds\nCompany A is an investment bank.

In such cases, companies may use appropriate sampling techniques to \nextrapolate data from a representative sample of activities within the category. \nCompanies may also choose to categorize activities into similar groups for data collection. This strategy should group \nactivities with similar anticipated emissions intensities. For example: \n \u2022Companies with a large number of leased assets (Categories 8 and 13) or franchises (Category 14) may group buildings by building type or floor area and vehicles by vehicle type\n \u2022Companies with a large number of employees collecting data on employee commuting (Category 7) may wish to extrapolate data from a representative sample of employees \n \u2022Companies with a large number of distribution channels may use sampling when calculating the emissions associated with Categories 4 and 9 (Transportation and Distribution).\nCompanies should choose a sampling method that aligns with their business goals and document and justify their choice. The choice of sampling method will depend on factors including, but not limited to:\n \u2022Available resources\n \u2022Number of data points\n \u2022Expected level of homogeneity between samples\n \u2022Geographical spread of data points\n \u2022Ease of data collection\n \u2022Timeframe available.\nUltimately, the use of sampling and choice of a specific sampling method aims to optimize the trade-off between cost and accurately representing all emission sources in the scope 3 category. Companies may use a variety of sampling methods, as appropriate for each specific emissions activity. Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [154] \nAPPENDIX A  SamplingSampling methods\nSampling methods available to companies include, but are not limited to:\n \u2022Simple random sampling\n \u2022Systematic sampling\n \u2022Stratified sampling\nEach approach is summarized below. Alternative methods for sampling may also be used. \nSimple Random Sampling\nSimple random sampling involves randomly selecting activities (i.e., a sample) from a larger set of activities (i.e., the \nentire population). \nIf the total number of activities from which a sample is selected is small, simple random sampling may be performed at \nits most basic level by selecting activities at random. If the total number of activities is large, for example with hundreds \nor thousands of activities, then random sampling is better performed by computer.\nAdvantages of simple random sampling include:\n \u2022With an appropriate sample size, simple random sampling creates a representative view of the entire population. \n(For example, if a company has fifty employees located within a close geographical area and wants to determine \nthe average commuting distance, it may choose to collect data from ten randomly selected employees as a \nrepresentative sample.)\n \u2022It is relatively straightforward to construct the sample.\nDisadvantages of simple random sampling include:\n \u2022The sample size needed to generate appropriately representative results may be prohibitively large and cumbersome to sample. (For example, if a retail organization has thousands of stores in many countries, randomly \nselecting individual stores may result in a difficult and time-consuming data collection process.)\n \u2022It may not be possible to obtain a complete list of all activities from the sample size, which is a prerequisite for \nsimple random sampling. (For example, if a distribution company wants to determine the average backhaul capacity \nof its trucks, it would have to list every journey before a random sample could be selected.)\nSystematic Sampling\nSystematic sampling involves randomly selecting the first item to sample and then selecting subsequent activities at \nregular intervals. \nAn appropriate sampling interval should be chosen so that the company achieves the desired sample size. For example, \nif a company sourced agricultural products from 100 farms but only wanted to sample 20 farms, an appropriate \nsampling interval would be every 5 farms. If the first farm to be sampled was picked as Farm 3, the company would \nsubsequently sample from Farms 8, 13, 18, 23,\u2026, 93, 98.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [155] \nAPPENDIX A  SamplingCalculation formula [A.1]  Selecting an appropriate systematic sampling interval\nSystematic sampling interval =\nsampling interval = total population size / desired sample size\nAdvantages of systematic sampling include:\n \u2022Simple to implement\n \u2022The population is guaranteed to be evenly sampled without risk that the sample points are clustered together.\nDisadvantages of systematic sampling include:\n \u2022If there is a periodic pattern in the population to be sampled, it could lead to biased sampling\n \u2022As with simple random sampling, it may not be possible to obtain a complete list of all activities in the population.\nStratified Sampling\nStratified sampling initially groups the population\u2019s activities into categories with similar characteristics. Random \nsampling is subsequently performed within these homogeneous groups.\nThe company should initially create population groups containing activities with characteristics likely to offer similar \nintensities of GHG emissions. Grouping variables could include location, size, building type, manufacturing technique, \nage, etc.\nFor example, if an agricultural produce company was assessing emissions from its farms, it may use the following \nvariable to create initial groupings of all farms: high / low rainfall; smaller than 100 hectares / larger than 100 hectares; north-facing-hill / south-facing-hill / neither.\nStratified sampling is particularly useful when the variability in GHG emissions within groups is small, but the variability \nbetween groups is large. \nAdvantages of stratified sampling:\n \u2022Can lead to higher precision because there is less variability within the groups given that similar characteristics are \ngrouped together.\n \u2022The necessary sample size can be reduced due to lower variability within groups, therefore saving time and money.\n \u2022Allows companies to draw insights into the source and level of emissions among different groups. This level of detail may be lost with simple random sampling.\n \u2022Different random sampling techniques may be employed for different groups as appropriate.\nDisadvantages of stratified sampling:\n \u2022Identifying appropriate variables and forming sampling groups may be difficult and complex.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [156] \nAPPENDIX A  SamplingSample Size\nDetermining sample size is fundamental to any sampling activity. The choice of sample size will be influenced by several \nfactors, including the likely significance of GHG emissions from the sources in question, the size of the population, the \nvariability of the emission sources, and the necessary degree of precision. \nDetermining sample size\nThere are several approaches to determining sample size. In particular, four alternative approaches may prove useful \nfor companies:\n \u2022Using the sample size of a similar inventory\n \u2022Using online calculators\n \u2022Using published tables\n \u2022Using formulas.\nUsing the sample size of a similar inventory\nCompanies may refer to similar inventories for guidance on appropriate sample size and sampling technique. When using this approach, companies should justify the similarity and appropriateness for the comparison. Companies may refer to \nsimilar inventories that have been externally verified for guidance on appropriate sample size and sampling technique.\nUsing online calculators\nOnline calculators are a quick and easy way to assess sample size. \nFor example:\n \u2022http://www.research-advisors.com/tools/SampleSize.htm provides a downloadable spreadsheet to calculate \nnecessary sample size with the ability to tailor the sampling criteria.\n \u2022http://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm provides an interactive online calculator for sample size; however, the choices for confidence level are fixed.\nUsing published tables\nMany published tables give the necessary sample size for a specific set of criteria. Such criteria include precision, confidence levels, and variability for a given population size.\nUsers should refer to standard statistics texts or search online for a table matching their specific sampling criteria.\nUsing formulas\nCompanies that want greater assurance for their choice of sample size may turn to established formulas. Formulas for \nthe calculation of sample size are available in all standard statistics and sampling text books, as well as via the internet. \nWhen applying sample size formulas, users may find it advantageous to seek the advice of a person with experience of \nstatistics.Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [157] \nAPPENDIX A  SamplingLevel of accuracy\nThe level of accuracy is related to the sample size, sampling strategy, and the measurement system. Assuming a \nnormal distribution, increasing the sample size is likely to reduce the sampling error using the relationship v = \u221an. In this \nrelationship \u201cv\u201d represents the variability of the data values. It is important to recognize that all measurements contain \nsome level of uncertainty. An estimate of the measurement uncertainty should be obtained, particularly for parts of the \nassessment that contribute significantly to the organization and/ or if subsequent investment decisions are made based \non the measurement. \nConfidence level\nAn estimate of the uncertainty, which should include both precision and bias from random error and systematic error respectively, will enable an interpretation of the measurement. For example, a level of uncertainty of \u00b15 percent would \nimply for an emissions estimate of 100 tonnes CO\n2e, that the actual emissions lie somewhere between 95 and 105 \ntonnes CO2e. The confidence level associated with the uncertainty normally corresponds to a 95 percent confidence \nlevel, that is, 2 standard deviations. For example, the true value lies in the range of 95 and 105 tonnes with 95 percent confidence. \nVariability\nVariability refers to the degree of difference between activities within the population. A population that is more \nheterogeneous (more variable) will require a larger sample size. A variability of 50 percent is the maximum level of \nvariability in a population. Therefore, a variability assumption of 0.5 is often used as a conservative estimate. Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [158] \n \n B\nAppendix B:\nScenario uncertainty  \nin calculating emissions  \nfrom the use of sold products\nScenario uncertainty assessment (also known as sensitivity analysis) is a useful tool \nto understand how changes in the product\u2019s design, use, and disposal could impact inventory results. It can be thought of as the impact of potential situations other \nthan the conditions and assumptions made in the product\u2019s inventory results and report. \nExample [ B.1]  Scenario analysis: measuring uncertainty in calculating emissions from the use of sold products\nCompany A produces electric fans for residential consumers. The electric fan has a wattage of 300. Company data \nindicates that consumers use the electric fan an average of 40 days a year, with an average use of 6 hours/day for a total \nof 5 years of use before disposing of the fan. \nTo calculate use-phase emissions, the company made the following calculations:\ntotal lifetime usage = 40 x 6 x 5 = 1,200 hours\nCO2e emissions per hour of use = wattage x electricity grid factor = 300 x 0.45 = 0.135 kg CO2e/hour use\nthe company sold 1,000 units in the reporting year, so total use-phase emissions for the reporting company  \n= 1,200 x 0.135 x 1,000 = 162,000 kg CO2e = 162 tonnes CO2eTechnical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions  [159] \nAPPENDIX B  Scenario uncertainty in calculating emissions from the use of sold products \n Exam ple [ B.1]  Scenario analysis: measuring uncertainty in calculating emissions from the use of sold products \n(continued)\nFor both the reporting company and stakeholders, it may be valuable to understand how a change in the use pattern \nwould change the inventory results. Company A has defined the average usage scenario in situation 1. However, based \non research the company conducted, the number of days that the electric fan is used could range between 20 and 60 \nper year, and the lifespan of the fan could range from 5 to 8 years. \nTo understand the impacts of the use phase of the electric fan in these different scenarios, four hypothetical scenarios \nwere developed based on the range of use days per year and the range of life span. Total use-phase emissions were then \ncalculated for each scenario.\nSituation Use days/year Use hours/day Use lifespan (years)\n1 40 6 5\n2 60 6 5\n3 60 6 8\n4 20 6 5\n5 20 6 8\n \nAs shown in the table and graph above, different scenarios show different use phase emissions. The scenario \nuncertainty analysis helps the reporting company ensure that the scenario used in the inventory is representative of the \nrange of scenarios, and not the scenario with the lowest emissions. \nIf the scenario uncertainty shows a very large range in emissions, and if this range is significant relative to total scope \n3 emissions, companies may choose to conduct more detailed analysis of the use profile of the product to more \naccurately calculate use-phase emissions and reduce the uncertainty.

Until recently, most companies have focused on measuring emissions from their own operations and electricity consumption, using the GHG Protocol\u2019s scope 1 and scope 2 framework. But what about all of the emissions a company is responsible for outside of its own walls\u2014from the goods it purchases to the disposal of the products it sells? The\u00a0Scope 3 Standard\u00a0is the only internationally accepted method for companies to account for these types of value chain emissions. Building on this standard, GHG Protocol has now released a companion guide that makes it even easier for businesses to complete their scope 3 inventories. Assessing GHG emissions across the entire value chain can be complex. For companies just beginning to assess their scope 3 emissions, it can be difficult to know where to start. This calculation guidance is designed to reduce those barriers by providing detailed, technical guidance on all the relevant calculation methods. It provides information not contained in the Scope 3 Standard, such as: The guidance can help companies understand the full climate change impact of their business throughout its value chain and develop more effective GHG reduction strategies. This increased understanding can benefit the companies themselves, as well as their suppliers, customers, and other value chain partners. The guidance was developed in partnership with the\u00a0Carbon Trust, whose GHG measurement expertise and practical experience has helped develop calculation guidance that provides a clear and coherent approach to carrying out a scope 3 assessment. A first draft of the calculation guidance was released in late 2011 for public comment. Based on the feedback received, a number of revisions were made to the guidance. These included: The guidance for each category of scope 3 emissions can be downloaded separately. Appendix D also contains a table that summarizes the different calculation methods available for each of the categories. The Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard allows companies to assess their entire value chain emissions impact and identify where to focus reduction activities. \n\n              Introduction\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 1.75 MB\n   \n\n              Category 1 - Purchased goods and services\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 607.85 KB\n   \n\n              Category 2 - Capital goods\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 181.49 KB\n   \n\n              Category 3 - Fuel- and energy-related activities\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 443.25 KB\n   \n\n              Category 4 - Upstream transportation and distribution\n          \n \n    Date: \n            October 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 567.97 KB\n   \n\n              Category 5 - Waste generated in operations\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 477.3 KB\n   \n\n              Category 6 - Business travel\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 233.89 KB\n   \n\n              Category 7 - Employee commuting\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 225.43 KB\n   \n\n              Category 8 - Upstream leased assets\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 234.59 KB\n   \n\n              Category 9 - Downstream transportation and distribution\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 334.68 KB\n   \n\n              Category 10 - Processing of sold products\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 230.57 KB\n   \n\n              Category 11 - Use of sold products\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 288.39 KB\n   \n\n              Category 12 - End-of-life treatment of sold products\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 200.77 KB\n   \n\n              Category 13 - Downstream leased assets\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 171.62 KB\n   \n\n              Category 14 - Franchises\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 229.08 KB\n   \n\n              Category 15 - Investments\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 327.61 KB\n   \n\n              Appendix A - Sampling\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 202.11 KB\n   \n\n              Appendix B - Scenario Uncertainty\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 182.33 KB\n   \n\n              Appendix C - Intensity Metrics\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 173.42 KB\n   \n\n              Appendix D - Summary Tables\n          \n \n    Date: \n            April 2013\n\n      \n    Size: 235.17 KB\n   New excel-based tool from Greenhouse Gas Protocol and WRI that helps companies estimate their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on the GHG Protocol. \u00a0 Cold-water laundry detergents, fuel-saving tires, energy-efficient ball bearings, emissions-saving data centers.
